        "We have recently described the presence of a guanylate cyclase [GTP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), EC 4.6.1.2] inhibitor (GCI) in an aqueous extract of the balsam pear (Momordica charantia abbreviata). Because the guanylate cyclase-cyclic GMP system is though to be involved in cell growth, DNA and RNA synthesis, and possible malignant transformation, we examined the effect of the aqueous extract containing GCI on an undifferentiated adenocarcinoma of the rat prostate and concanavalin-A-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation into cultured splenic lymphocytes, a process thought to be mediated by cyclic GMP. The results demonstrate that the extract of the balsam pear blocks both the growth of the rat prostatic adencarcinoma in vitro and [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. DNA histograms from flow cytometry indicated that the extract containing GCI inhibited in the G2 + M phase of the cell cycle, a presumed locus of cyclic GMP effects. In addition, guanylate cyclase activity was significantly greater in the tumor than normal prostate tissue and was decreased by the extract containing GCI. Cyclic GMP levels in the tumor in culture wer also decreased by addition of the extract. It remains to be determined whether or not the anti-tumor agent and GCI are the same substance.",

Study of their in vitro cytotoxicities showed that the two proteins selectively injured choriocarcinoma and melanoma cells. Hepatoma cells represented the most resistant cell line among the various cell lines investigated. Cytotoxicity profiles of trichosanthin and alpha-momorcharin differed from those of anti-cancer drugs which interfere with DNA metabolism such as cisplatin, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil. Radioactive precursor incorporation studies suggested that the two abortifacient proteins inhibited cellular protein synthesis. The marked decrease in secretion of human chorionic gonadotrophin and progesterone by choriocarcinoma cells after treatment with the proteins could be attributed mainly to loss of cells.",

        "Many natural agents including fruits and vegetables are known to provide protection from different degenerative diseases including cancer, by preventing damage to the cellular components. The effect of two important dietary agents, alpha tocopherol, and the flavonoid quercetin, along with two commonly consumed vegetables, bitter gourd and tomato, were investigated on spontaneous and dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-induced DNA damage in murine lymphocytes in vitro. DNA damage was determined by single cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay). The rationale for such an approach for this study is that DNA damage can lead to genetic disorders that occur at different stages of carcinogenesis and protection from such damages may in the long run help to prevent development of cancer. Both alpha tocopherol and quercetin as single agents were found to be potent inhibitors of DNA damage (spontaneous and carcinogen induced) in a dose-dependent manner. Fresh juices of bitter gourd and tomato could also protect from DMBA-induced DNA damage but not as effectively as the single agents. The anticarcinogenic role of nutrients as well as non-nutrient dietary components need to be explored more extensively. The Comet assay is a simple, fast, and reliable method to determine the protective effect against DNA damage, one of the prerequisites for carcinogenesis.",

        2003,
        "Cervical cancer patients have a defective immune system. There is a decrease of total white blood cell count including lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells. NK cells, one type of lymphocytes, play a role to eliminate cancer cells by antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) mechanism. Previous studies have shown that P-glycoprotein (170 kDa, transmembrane protein) may be a transporter for cytokine releasing in ADCC mechanism. This study proposed to explore the role of bitter melon intake in cervical cancer patients undergoing normal treatment (radiotherapy). Subjects were divided into three groups: 1) normal control (women 35-55 years, n = 35), 2) patient control (n = 30) and 3) patient treatment (n = 30) groups. Patient control and patient treatment groups were cervical cancer patients (stage II or III) treated with radiotherapy (without or with bitter melon ingestion). Blood samples of patient control and patient treatment groups were analyzed for NK cells percentage and P-glycoprotein level. Bitter melon is a Thai herb. Previous studies have shown that bitter melon can stimulate lymphocyte activity in vitro and in vivo (mouse). The authors hope that bitter melon could stimulate the increase of NK cells percentage and P-glycoprotein level on the membrane in blood samples from cervical cancer patients who ingest bitter melon. The results showed an increased percentage of NK cells in patient control and patient treatment groups. The increase in each group is significant (p < 0.05) when compared with the percentage of NK cells from second and third blood sampling time (after radiation with of without bitter melon intake for 45 and 90 days) with first blood sampling time (before treatment). The results also show a significant decrease of P-glycoprotein level (p < 0.05) in second and third blood sampling times when compared with first blood sampling time of the patient treatment group. There was no significant difference of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) level from first, second and third blood sampling times in patient control group. Bitter melon ingestion did not affect NK cell level but it affected the decrease of P-gp level on NK cell membrane.",

Aqueous extracts of bitter gourd and tomato juice were found to be very potent inhibitors of lipid peroxidation both in normal and DMBA treated mice.

In this study, we investigated the anti-proliferative and apoptosis-inducing effects of free fatty acids prepared from BGO (BGO-FFA) using colon cancer Caco-2 cells. BGO-FFA and purified 9c,11t,13t-CLN remarkably reduced the cell viability of Caco-2.

The expression level of apoptosis suppressor Bcl-2 protein was also decreased by BGO-FFA treatment. The GADD45 and p53, which play an important role in apoptosis-inducing pathways, were remarkably up-regulated by BGO-FFA treatment in Caco-2 cells. Up-regulation of PPARgamma mRNA and protein were also observed during apoptosis induced by BGO-FFA.

        2007,
        "BACKGROUND: Peritoneal carcinomatosis from pancreatic cancer has a poor prognosis with a median survival of 3.1 months. This is mainly due to lack of effective treatment. Interleukin 12 (IL12) is a proinflammatory cytokine that has a potent antitumoral effect by stimulating innate and adoptive immunity. AIM: To examine the antitumoral effect and toxicity of intraperitoneal delivery of IL12 using an ex vivo gene therapy approach in a murine model of pancreatic peritoneal carcinomatosis. METHODS: Peritoneal carcinomatosis was generated by direct intraperitoneal inoculation of the pancreatic cancer cell line Capan-1 in athymic mice. Syngenic fibroblasts were genetically modified in vitro to secrete IL12 using a polycistronic TFG murine IL12 retroviral vector coding for both p35 and p40 murine IL12 subunits. Ex vivo gene therapy involved injection of the genetically modified fibroblasts intraperitoneally twice a week for 4 weeks. RESULTS: Treatment of pre-established peritoneal carcinomatosis with fibroblasts genetically modified to express IL12 induced a marked inhibition of tumour growth as measured by comparison of the weights of the intraperitoneal tumour nodules in the treated and control animals (3.52 (SD 0.47) v 0.93 (SD 0.21) g, p<0.05) and improved survival. This effect was associated with infiltration of the peritoneal tumour nodules with macrophages. Peritoneal lavage confirmed enhancement of the innate peritoneal inflammatory activity, with an increased number of activated macrophages and natural killer cells. Moreover, macrophages harvested from animals with peritoneal carcinomatosis and treated with IL12-expressing fibroblasts expressed an activated proinflammatory antitumoral M1 phenotype that included strongly enhanced reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide production. There was no treatment-related toxicity. CONCLUSION: Multiple injections of genetically modified fibroblasts to express IL12 is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for experimental murine pancreatic peritoneal carcinomatosis via activated innate immunity and in particular activated M1 macrophages.",

METHODS: The callus extract react with silver nitrate solution confirmed silver nanoparticles synthesis through the steady change of greenish colour to reddish brown and characterized by using FT-IR, AFM. Toxicity on HEp 2 cell line assessed using MTT assay, caspase -3 assay, Lactate dehydrogenase leakage assay and DNA fragmentation assay. RESULTS: The synthesized silver nanoparticles were generally found to be spherical in shape with size 31 nm by AFM.

Here we report for the first time purification and characterization of a 14-kDa RNase, designated as RNase MC2, in the seeds of bitter gourd (Momordica charantia). RNase MC2 manifested potent RNA-cleavage activity toward baker's yeast tRNA, tumor cell rRNA, and an absolute specificity for uridine. RNase MC2 demonstrated both cytostatic and cytotoxic activities against MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with RNase MC2 caused nuclear damage (karyorrhexis, chromatin condensation, and DNA fragmentation), ultimately resulting in early/late apoptosis. Further molecular studies unveiled that RNase MC2 induced differential activation of MAPKs (p38, JNK and ERK) and Akt. On the other hand, RNase MC2 exposure activated caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-7, increased the production of Bak and cleaved PARP, which in turn contributed to the apoptotic response. In conclusion, RNase MC2 is a potential agent which can be exploited in the worldwide fight against breast cancer.",

The purpose of this study was to elucidate whether cucurbitacin E promotes cell cycle arrest and induces apoptosis in T24 cells and further to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. The effects of cucurbitacin E on T24 cell's growth and accompanied morphological changes were examined by MTT assay and a phase-contrast microscope. DNA content, mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) and annexin V/PI staining were determined by flow cytometry. The protein levels were measured by Western blotting. Our results demonstrated that cucurbitacin E-induced G(2)/M arrest was associated with a marked increase in the levels of p53, p21 and a decrease in phospho-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) and cyclin B.

However, little is known about their anti-liver cancer properties and antiviral activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV). The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-liver cancer and anti-HBV activities of crude extracts from these edible plants on human liver cancer cells. METHODS: Plant samples were prepared and extracted using buffer and hydro-alcoholic solvents. The MTT assay was performed to investigate the effects of the plant extracts on the cell viability of HepG2 cells. The inhibitory effect on replication of HBV was analysed by determining the level of HBV covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) in transiently transfected HepG2 cells with the DNA expression plasmid of the HBV genome using a quantitative real-time PCR. RESULTS: Buffer and hydroalcoholic extracts from C. formosum (leaf) reduced cell viability of HepG2 cells and they also inhibited HBV cccDNA. Crude extracts from C. longa (bulb) in both solvents did not have any cytotoxic effects on the HepG2 cells, but they significantly decreased the level of HBV cccDNA. Buffer extracts from the leaves of M. charantia and the fruits of M. oleifera showed to have anti-HBV activity and also a mild cytotoxicity effect on the HepG2 cells. In addition, leaves of M. Oleifera extracted by hydroalcoholic solvent drastically decreased the level of cccDNA in transiently transfected HepG2 cells.

We used a medicinally rich vegetable crop, bitter melon, as a model to evaluate the effects of seed treatment with a carbon-based nanoparticle, fullerol [C60(OH)20], on yield of plant biomass and fruit characters, and phytomedicine contents in fruits. RESULTS: We confirmed the uptake, translocation and accumulation of fullerol through bright field imaging and Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy. We observed varied effects of seed treatment at five concentrations, including non-consequential and positive, on plant biomass yield, fruit yield and its component characters, and content of five phytomedicines in fruits. Fullerol-treatment resulted in increases up to 54% in biomass yield and 24% in water content. Increases of up to 20% in fruit length, 59% in fruit number, and 70% in fruit weight led to an improvement up to 128% in fruit yield. Contents of two anticancer phytomedicines, cucurbitacin-B and lycopene, were enhanced up to 74% and 82%, respectively, and contents of two antidiabetic phytomedicines, charantin and insulin, were augmented up to 20% and 91%, respectively. Non-significant correlation inter se plant biomass, fruit yield, phytomedicine content and water content evidenced for separate genetic control and biosynthetic pathways for production of plant biomass, fruits, and phytomedicines in fruits, and also no impact of increased water uptake. CONCLUSIONS: While our results indicated possibility of improving crop yield and quality by using proper concentrations of fullerol, extreme caution needs to be exercised given emerging knowledge about accumulation and toxicity of nanoparticles in bodily tissues.",

Cell proliferation was significantly suppressed following alphaMMC and MAP30 treatment in a dose and timedependent manner; in addition, the results indicated that MAP30 had a more potent antitumor activity compared with that of alphaMMC. Cell cycle arrest in S phase and a significantly increased apoptotic rate were observed following treatment with alphaMMC and MAP30. Furthermore, DNA integrity analysis revealed that the DNA of A549 cells was degraded following treatment with alphaMMC and MAP30 for 48 h. The pyrogallol autoxidation method and nitrotetrazolium blue chloride staining were used to determine SOD activity, the results of which indicated that alphaMMC and MAP30 did not possess SOD activity. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicated that alphaMMC and MAP30 may have potential as novel therapeutic agents for the prophylaxis and treatment of cancer.",

        2015,
        "MAP30 (Momordica Antiviral Protein 30 Kd), a single-stranded type-I ribosome inactivating protein, possesses versatile biological activities including anti-tumor abilities. However, the low efficiency penetrating into tumor cells hampers the tumoricidal effect of MAP30. This paper describes MAP30 fused with a human-derived cell penetrating peptide HBD which overcome the low uptake efficiency by tumor cells and exhibits higher anti-tumor bioactivity. MAP30 gene was cloned from the genomic DNA of Momordica charantia and the recombinant plasmid pET28b-MAP30-HBD was established and transferred into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The recombinant MAP30-HBD protein (rMAP30-HBD) was expressed in a soluble form after being induced by 0.5mM IPTG for 14h at 15 degrees C. The recombinant protein was purified to greater than 95% purity with Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The rMAP30-HBD protein not only has topological inactivation and protein translation inhibition activity but also showed significant improvements in cytotoxic activity compared to that of the rMAP30 protein without HBD in the tested tumor cell lines, and induced higher apoptosis rates in HeLa cells analyzed by Annexin V-FITC with FACS. This paper demonstrated a new method for improving MAP30 protein anti-tumor activity and might have potential applications in cancer therapy area.",

        "Cucurbitacin B (Cuc B), a natural compound extracted from cucurbitaceous plants, demonstrated potent anticancer activities, while the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We investigated the anticancer effect of Cuc B on MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Cuc B drastically decreased cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner. Cuc B treatment caused DNA damage, as shown by long tails in the comet assay and increased gammaH2AX protein expression. Immunofluorescence staining showed that Cuc B treatment induced nuclear gammaH2AX foci. Cuc B activated DNA damage pathways by phosphorylation of ATM/ATR [two large phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-like kinase family (PIKKs) members]. Furthermore, it also induced autophagy, as evidenced by monodansylcadaverine (MDC) staining and autophagic protein expression. In addition, Cuc B treatment led to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, which was inhibited by N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) pretreatment. NAC pretreatment inhibited Cuc-B-induced DNA damage and autophagy. Taken together, these results suggest that ROS-mediated Cuc-B-induced DNA damage and autophagy in MCF-7 cells, which provides new insights into the anticancer molecular mechanism of Cuc B.",

        2015,
        "Momordica charantia is a thermophilic voluble plant from the tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa and the Caribbean. In central Europe, momordica requires greenhouse plantations. Mature fruits resemble a cucumber or a pumpkin and can be used as other similar vegetables. Crude fruits are very bitter and refreshing. For centuries the plant has been known in Chinese traditional medicine for its antidiabetic effects as well as for the treatment of cancer or infections caused by worms, viruses and malaria. Antidiabetic effects are attributed namely to cucurbitane type triterpenoids, charantin, p-insulin and 9cis-11trans-13trans-conjugated linolenic acid. These substances in momordica preparations show antidiabetic effectiveness in clinical studies by increasing insulin secretion and deceasing insulin resistance or glucose absorption from the gut. Beside this main effect the extract possesses certain neuroprotective and antioxidant effects (especially p9cis-11trans-13trans-conjugated linolenic acid) and contributes to normalize blood lipid and adipokine levels which results in the normalization of metabolic syndrome. Antidiabetic effectiveness of momordica was compared to active treatment with several oral antidiabetic drugs and proved comparable effects. However, the number of studies is limited and their methodological approach variable. Therefore, the evidence is so far inconclusive.",

        2017,
        "Alpha-momorcharin (alpha-MMC), a type I ribosome-inactivating protein, has attracted a great deal of attention because of its antitumor activity. However, the cytotoxicity of alpha-MMC is limited due to insufficient cellular internalization in cancer cells. To enhance the cytotoxicity of alpha-MMC, a heparin-binding domain derived from heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (named heparin-binding peptide [HBP]) was used as a cell-penetrating peptide and fused to the C-terminus of alpha-MMC. This novel alpha-MMC-HBP fusion protein was expressed and purified with a Ni(2+) -resin. The N-glycosidase activity and DNase activity assay indicated that the introduction of HBP did not interfere with the intrinsic bioactivities of alpha-MMC. HBP was able to efficiently carry alpha-MMC into the tested cancer cells and significantly enhance the cytotoxic effects of alpha-MMC in a dose-dependent manner. This enhanced cytotoxic ability occurred due to the higher level of cell apoptosis induced by alpha-MMC-HBP, which was demonstrated in western blot analysis in which alpha-MMC-HBP triggered caspase 8, caspase 9, casapase 3, and PARP more intensely than alpha-MMC alone. alpha-MMC-HBP led to an upregulation of cleaved PARP and an increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Our study provided a new practical way to greatly improve the antitumor activity of alpha-MMC, which could significantly expand the pharmaceutical applications of alpha-MMC.",

Commonly, natural products are structurally complex chemical compounds that efficiently interact with their biological targets, making them useful drug candidates in cancer therapy. Here, we used cell-based phenotypic profiling and image-based high-content screening to study the mode of action and potential cellular targets of plants historically used in Saudi Arabia's traditional medicine. We compared the cytological profiles of fractions taken from Juniperus phoenicea (Arar), Anastatica hierochuntica (Kaff Maryam), and Citrullus colocynthis (Hanzal) with a set of reference compounds with established modes of action. Cluster analyses of the cytological profiles of the tested compounds suggested that these plants contain possible topoisomerase inhibitors that could be effective in cancer treatment. Using histone H2AX phosphorylation as a marker for DNA damage, we discovered that some of the compounds induced double-strand DNA breaks. Furthermore, chemical analysis of the active fraction isolated from Juniperus phoenicea revealed possible anti-cancer compounds. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of cell-based phenotypic screening of natural products to reveal their biological activities.",

Results showed that M. charantia seed extract effectively inhibited the mycelial growth of F. solani, with a 50% inhibitory rate (IC50) value of 108.934 mug/mL. Further analysis with optical microscopy and fluorescence microscopy revealed that the seed extract led to deformation of cells with irregular budding, loss of integrity of cell wall, as well as disruption of the fungal cell membrane. In addition, genomic DNA was also severely affected, as small DNA fragments shorter than 50 bp appeared on agarose gel. These findings implied that M. charantia seed extract containing alpha-momorcharin, a typical ribosome-inactivating protein, could be an effective agent in the control of fungal pathogens, and such natural products would represent a sustainable alternative to the use of synthetic fungicides.",

        "Pancreatic cancer (PanC) is one of the deadliest malignancies worldwide and frontline treatment with gemcitabine becomes eventually ineffective due to increasing PanC resistance, suggesting additional approaches are needed to manage PanC. Recently, we have shown the efficacy of bitter melon juice (BMJ) against PanC cells, including those resistant to gemcitabine. As cancer stem cells (CSCs) are actively involved in PanC initiation, progression, relapse and drug-resistance, here we assessed BMJ ability in targeting pancreatic cancer-associated cancer stem cells (PanC-CSCs). We found BMJ efficacy against CD44(+) /CD24(+) /EpCAM(high) enriched PanC-CSCs in spheroid assays; BMJ also increased the sensitivity of gemcitabine-resistant PanC-CSCs. Exogenous addition of BMJ to PanC-CSC generated spheroids (not pre-exposed to BMJ) also significantly reduced spheroid number and size. Mechanistically, BMJ effects were associated with a decrease in the expression of genes and proteins involved in PanC-CSC renewal and proliferation. Specifically, immunofluorescence staining showed that BMJ decreases protein expression/nuclear localization of CSC-associated transcription factors SOX2, OCT4 and NANOG, and CSC marker CD44. Immunohistochemical analysis of MiaPaCa2 xenografts from BMJ treated animals also showed a significant decrease in the levels of CSC-associated transcription factors. Together, these results show BMJ potential in targeting PanC-CSC pool and associated regulatory pathways, suggesting the need for further investigation of its efficacy against PanC growth and progression including gemcitabine-resistant PanC.",

Methods: Twenty-five (25) adult rats weighing between 90-120 g were divided into 5 groups namely RA, RB, RC, NC and PC, each group had 5 rats. The PC which served as the control was fed with normal fish meal and water ad libitum; the NC which is the negative control received 20 mg/ml/week of Nitrosamines only while other groups received different concentrations of aqueous extract of both M.charantia and O.basilicum (200 mg, 100 mg, 50 mg) and Nitrosamine. Qualitative phytochemical screening of the aqueous extract of both M.charantia and O.basilicum was carried out. The extraction of DNA was done using Jena Bioscience DNA preparation kit and the protocol was based on the spin column based genomic DNA purification from blood, animal and plant cells. Agarose gel electrophoresis was used to analyze the K-ras gene extracted from the pancreas tissues of experimental rats while hematoxylinand eosin staining was used for histological assay. Results: Phytochemical screening revealed the presence of alkaloids, tannins, flavonoids, saponins and glycosides in M.charantia while saponins, tannins and glycosides were discovered in O.basilicum. Significant reduction in the weight of rats treated with 200 mg of aqueous extracts of M.charantia and O.basilicum while rats that were dosed with nitrosamines only showed a slight increase in weight in the first three weeks when compared to the positive control. Histological studies revealed that there is both enlargement and reduction in the islet cell size, with one of the sections showing a normal islet cell size. While the agarose gel electrophoresis revealed that there may be possibility of prevention of damage to k-ras gene as a result of the effect of plants extract. Conclusion: This work has shown that the leaf extracts of both M.charantia and O.basilicum will serve as a measure against induced pancreatic cancer in rats.",

On the other hand, extracts of Bupleurum falcatum L at 100mug/mL induced significant increases in the 8-OHdG biomarker (P<0.01). Finally, Ficus palmate, Zygophyllum Simplex, Citrullus colocynthis did not modulate levels of 8-OHdG in cultured human lymphocytes at examined concentrations (10 and 100mug/mL, P>0.05). In conclusion, extracts from Nigella sativa, Olea chrysophylla and Pulicaria cripa medicinal plants can be used as useful agents to counteract oxidative DNA damage in cultured cells.",

The potency of the immunotoxin on PBMC was very high (IC50 = 1 - 10 pM) and was not affected by blood components. The conjugate was also very efficient in the inhibition of the proliferative response in a mixed lymphocyte reaction (IC50 = 10 pM). Moreover, the in vitro performance of the immunotoxin compared favorably with those reported for other anti-CD5-based immunoconjugates containing ricin A chain. The in vivo activity of the immunotoxin was assessed in the model of nu/nu mice bearing Jurkat leukemia. A significant inhibition of the tumour development (80%, P < 0.01) in the animals treated with immunotoxin was observed.

        "The anti-HIV agent MAP30 (Momordica anti-HIV protein, 30 kDa) inhibits the proliferation of BC-2, an AIDS-related primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cell line derived from an AIDS patient. BC-2 cells are latently infected with Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV), also known as human herpes virus 8 (HHV8). We examined the effect of MAP30 on the expression of viral and cellular genes in BC-2 during latent and lytic states of the viral life cycle. By Northern analysis and RT-PCR, we found that MAP30 downregulates the expression of viral cyclin D (vCD), viral interleukin-6 (vIL-6), and viral FLIP (vFLIP), genes involved in cell cycle regulation, viral pathogenesis, and apoptosis. By pathway-specific cDNA microarray analysis, we found that BC-2 cells express high levels of egr-1, ATF-2, hsp27, hsp90, IkappaB, mdm2, skp1, and IL-2, cellular genes involved in mitogenesis, tumorigenesis, and inhibition of apoptosis in NFkappaB and p53 signaling pathways. These results define for the first time the specific cellular pathways involved in AIDS-related tumorigenesis and suggest specific novel targets for the treatment. Furthermore, we found that MAP30 downregulates the expression of egr-1, ATF-2, hsp27, hsp90, IkappaB, mdm2, and Skp1, while it upregulates the pro-apoptotic-related genes Bax, CRADD, and caspase-3. Thus, MAP30 modulates the expression of both viral and cellular genes involved in KS pathogenesis. These results provide valuable insight into the molecular mechanisms of MAP30 anti-KS action and suggest its utility as a therapeutic agent against AIDS-related tumors.",

Traditional botanical medicine is the primary mode of healthcare for most of the rural population in Arunachal Pradesh. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Field research was conducted between April 2006 and March 2009 with randomly selected 124 key informants using semi-structured questionnaire. The data obtained was analyzed through informant consensus factor (FIC) to determine the homogeneity of informant's knowledge on medicinal plants. RESULTS: We documented 50 plants species belonging to 29 families used for treating 22 human and 4 veterinary ailments. Of the medicinal plants reported, the most common growth form was herbs (40%) followed by shrubs, trees, and climbers. Leaves were most frequently used plant parts. The consensus analysis revealed that the dermatological ailments have the highest FIC (0.56) and the gastro-intestinal diseases have FIC (0.43). FIC values indicated that there was high agreement in the use of plants in dermatological and gastro-intestinal ailments category among the users. Gymnocladus assamicus is a critically rare and endangered species used as disinfectant for cleaning wounds and parasites like leeches and lice on livestocks. Two plant species (Illicium griffithii and Rubia cordifolia) are commonly used for traditional dyeing of clothes and food items. Some of the edible plants recorded in this study were known for their treatment against high blood pressure (Clerodendron colebrookianum), diabetes mellitus (Momordica charantia), and intestinal parasitic worms like round and tape worms (Lindera neesiana, Solanum etiopicum, and Solanum indicum). The Monpas of Arunachal Pradesh have traditionally been using Daphne papyracea for preparing hand-made paper for painting and writing religious scripts in Buddhist monasteries. Three plant species (Derris scandens, Aesculus assamica, and Polygonum hydropiper) were frequently used to poison fish during the month of June-July every year and the underground tuber of Aconitum ferrox is widely used in arrow poisoning to kill ferocious animals like bear, wild pigs, gaur and deer. The most frequently cited plant species; Buddleja asiatica and Hedyotis scandens were used as common growth supplements during the preparation of fermentation starter cultures. CONCLUSION: The traditional pharmacopoeia of the Monpa ethnic group incorporates a myriad of diverse botanical flora. Traditional knowledge of the remedies is passed down through oral traditions without any written document. This traditional knowledge is however, currently threatened mainly due to acculturation and deforestation due to continuing traditional shifting cultivation. This study reveals that the rural populations in Arunachal Pradesh have a rich knowledge of forest-based natural resources and consumption of wild edible plants is still an integral part of their socio-cultural life. Findings of this documentation study can be used as an ethnopharmacological basis for selecting plants for future phytochemical and pharmaceutical studies.",

There is a rapidly growing trend towards the use of Complementary and Alternative Medical practices in Diabetes. Sri Lanka is a developing Asian nation with a rich culture of Ayurvedic and native medical culture. The objective of this study was to find the prevalence of use of CAMs in a diabetic population attending a large multiethnic diabetes facility in a University unit and to assess whether there is an increase in the incidence of hypoglycaemic episodes among users of CAMs. METHODS: A cross sectional study was performed at Teaching Hospital Peradeniya between April and August 2012. Following verbal consent, 254 type 2 adult diabetic patients attending the diabetes facility were interviewed regarding the use of CAM and hypoglycaemia using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: Of the 252 valid results, 192 patients (76%) admitted to the use of a CAM to reduce blood glucose. Bitter gourd, ivy gourd and crepe ginger were used by 128, 113 and 92 individuals. While 19% used a single agent, 34%, 21% and 2.4% used 2,3 and more than 3 agents. The incidence of hypoglycaemia in CAM users was 21% and 16.6% in non-users. The difference was statistically not significant. (p = 0.57) Ingestion of Costus speciosus (Crepe ginger) was associated with higher incidence of hypoglycaemia (P = 0.01).Female gender was significantly associated with CAM use (p = 0.01), while the age, duration of diabetes, presence of co-morbidities and complications of diabetes failed to show a significant association. CONCLUSION: Sri Lanka has a very high use of herbal supplementation in type 2 diabetes patients. Although the overall incidence of hypoglycaemia is not increased among CAM users, crepe ginger is associated with significant hypoglycaemia and warrants further research.",

        "lipid - Urinary lysophopholipids are increased in diabetic patients with nephropathy.",
        2017,
        "Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a major cause of chronic kidney disease that frequently leads to end stage renal failure. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) are lysophospholipid mediators shown to accumulate in kidney and to promote renal inflammation and tubulo-interstitial fibrosis in diabetic rodent models. Here we assessed whether LPA and LPC were associated to the development of nephropathy in diabetic human patients. Several molecular species of LPA and LPC were quantified by LC/MS-MS in urine and plasma from type 2 diabetic patients with (cases; n=41) or without (controls, n=41) nephropathy symptoms (micro/macro-albuminuria and eGFR<60ml/min/1.73m(2)). Cases and controls were matched for sex, age and diabetes duration. Six species were detected in urine for both LPA and LPC, LPA16:0, LPA20:4, LPC16:0, LPC18:0, LPC18:1, and LPC18:2 that were significantly more concentrated in cases than in controls. Total LPC and LPA (sum of detected species) were significantly and exclusively associated with albuminuria (P<0.0001 and P=0.0009 respectively) and were significantly higher in the 3rd when compared to the 1st albuminuria tertile in cases. Plasma lysophospholipids showed a different species profile urine and their concentrations were not different between cases and controls. In conclusion, urine concentration of lysophospholipids increases in diabetic patients with DN as the likely result of their co-excretion with albumin combined with possible local production by kidney. Because LPA and LPC are known to promote renal inflammation and tubulo-interstitial fibrosis, their increased production in DN could participate to the development of kidney damage associated with diabetes.",

        "glucose - Estrogen receptor subcellular localization and cardiometabolism.",
        2018,
        "BACKGROUND: In addition to their crucial role in reproduction, estrogens are key regulators of energy and glucose homeostasis and they also exert several cardiovascular protective effects. These beneficial actions are mainly mediated by estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), which is widely expressed in metabolic and vascular tissues. As a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, ERalpha was primarily considered as a transcription factor that controls gene expression through the activation of its two activation functions (ERalphaAF-1 and ERalphaAF-2). However, besides these nuclear actions, a pool of ERalpha is localized in the vicinity of the plasma membrane, where it mediates rapid signaling effects called membrane-initiated steroid signals (MISS) that have been well described in vitro, especially in endothelial cells. SCOPE OF THE REVIEW: This review aims to summarize our current knowledge of the mechanisms of nuclear vs membrane ERalpha activation that contribute to the cardiometabolic protection conferred by estrogens. Indeed, new transgenic mouse models (affecting either DNA binding, activation functions or membrane localization), together with the use of novel pharmacological tools that electively activate membrane ERalpha effects recently allowed to begin to unravel the different modes of ERalpha signaling in vivo. CONCLUSION: Altogether, available data demonstrate the prominent role of ERalpha nuclear effects, and, more specifically, of ERalphaAF-2, in the preventive effects of estrogens against obesity, diabetes, and atheroma. However, membrane ERalpha signaling selectively mediates some of the estrogen endothelial/vascular effects (NO release, reendothelialization) and could also contribute to the regulation of energy balance, insulin sensitivity, and glucose metabolism. Such a dissection of ERalpha biological functions related to its subcellular localization will help to understand the mechanism of action of \"old\" ER modulators and to design new ones with an optimized benefit/risk profile.",

        2018,
        "BACKGROUND: Hypoglycaemia is a feared experience for people with diabetes. We aimed to study the prevalence and causes of hypoglycaemia among Sri Lankans with diabetes. METHODS: One thousand patients with diabetes attending a private sector diabetic clinic were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Hypoglycaemic episodes within the preceding month were inquired and severity was graded according to clinical features and/or capillary blood glucose levels. RESULTS: Mean age 55.0 years (+/- 12.5), 58.6% were males, mean diabetes duration 10.6 years (+/- 8.1), mean FPG 7.48 mmol/l (+/- 2.79) and mean HbA1c 7.82% (+/- 1.71) (62 mmol/mol). Of them, 26.1%. (mild 20.7%, moderate 3.9%, and severe 1.5%) experienced symptomatic hypoglycaemia. Sudden change diet (46.7%), unaccustomed exercise (15.7%) and increase in antihyperglycaemic therapy dosage (14.9%) were the recognized causes. Cause was not recognized by 16.3%. Non-prescribed native food items accounted for hypoglycaemia in 16.9% of patients (Momordica charantia 54.5%, Costus speciosus 52.3%, Salacia prinoides 11.4%, Coccinia grandis 6.8%, Adenanthera pavonina 4.5%). Severity of hypoglycaemia was positively correlated to age and duration of diabetes but not to HbA1C. CONCLUSION: Hypoglycaemia is common among patients with diabetes. Patients need advice on regular diet and exercise. Consumption of non-prescribed native foods should be considered as a possible cause.",

        "Owing to the use of porphyrins in photodynamic therapy for the treatment of malignant tumors, and the preferential interaction of lectins with tumor cells, studies on lectin-porphyrin interaction are of significant interest. In this study, the interaction of several free-base and metalloporphyrins with Momordica charantia (bitter gourd) lectin (MCL) was investigated by absorption spectroscopy. Difference absorption spectra revealed that significant changes occur in the Soret band region of the porphyrins on binding to MCL. These changes were monitored to obtain association constants (Ka) and stoichiometry of binding. The tetrameric MCL binds four porphyrin molecules, and the stoichiometry was unaffected by the presence of the specific sugar, lactose. In addition, the agglutination activity of MCL was unaffected by the presence of the porphyrins used in this study, clearly indicating that porphyrin and carbohydrate ligands bind at different sites. Both cationic and anionic porphyrins bind to the lectin with comparable affinity (Ka =10(3)-10(5) m(-1)). The thermodynamic parameters associated with the interaction of several porphyrins, obtained from the temperature dependence of the Ka values, were found to be in the range: DeltaH degrees = -98.1 to -54.4 kJ.mol(-1) and DeltaS degrees =-243.9 to -90.8 J.mol(-1).K(-1). These results indicate that porphyrin binding to MCL is governed by enthalpic forces and that the contribution from binding entropy is negative. Enthalpy-entropy compensation was observed in the interaction of different porphyrins with MCL, underscoring the role of water structure in the overall binding process. Analysis of CD spectra of MCL indicates that this protein contains about 13%alpha-helix, 36%beta-sheet, 21%beta-turn, and the rest unordered structures. Binding of porphyrins does not significantly alter the secondary and tertiary structures of MCL.",

Known or potential drug-herb interactions exist and should be screened for. If used beyond 8 weeks, Echinacea could cause hepatotoxicity and therefore should not be used with other known hepatoxic drugs, such as anabolic steroids, amiodarone, methotrexate, and ketoconazole. However, Echinacea lacks the 1,2 saturated necrine ring associated with hepatoxicity of pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may negate the usefulness of feverfew in the treatment of migraine headaches. Feverfew, garlic, Ginkgo, ginger, and ginseng may alter bleeding time and should not be used concomitantly with warfarin sodium. Additionally, ginseng may cause headache, tremulousness, and manic episodes in patients treated with phenelzine sulfate. Ginseng should also not be used with estrogens or corticosteroids because of possible additive effects. Since the mechanism of action of St John wort is uncertain, concomitant use with monoamine oxidase inhibitors and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors is ill advised. Valerian should not be used concomitantly with barbiturates because excessive sedation may occur. Kyushin, licorice, plantain, uzara root, hawthorn, and ginseng may interfere with either digoxin pharmacodynamically or with digoxin monitoring. Evening primrose oil and borage should not be used with anticonvulsants because they may lower the seizure threshold. Shankapulshpi, an Ayurvedic preparation, may decrease phenytoin levels as well as diminish drug efficacy. Kava when used with alprazolam has resulted in coma. Immunostimulants (eg, Echinacea and zinc) should not be given with immunosuppressants (eg, corticosteroids and cyclosporine). Tannic acids present in some herbs (eg, St John wort and saw palmetto) may inhibit the absorption of iron. Kelp as a source of iodine may interfere with thyroid replacement therapies.

        "The arachidonate cascade includes the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway to form prostanoids and the lipoxygenase (LOX) pathway to generate several oxygenated fatty acids, collectively called eicosanoids. Eicosanoids are suggested to play a dual role in regulating cell survival and apoptosis in various types of cells through an unknown mechanism. We found apoptosis in cultured Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells treated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol beta-acetate (TPA), a potent tumor promoter, and nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), a LOX inhibitor. The effect of TPA was synergistically stimulated along with NDGA. Aspirin, a COX inhibitor, was not effective. The target of NDGA might be different from the mechanism involving a LOX activity in some kinds of carcinoma cells because the increased expression of 12-LOX was not detected in MDCK cells treated with TPA. Caspase and poly(ADP-ribose) metabolites were found to be involved in the signal transduction pathway of the TPA- and NDGA-induced apoptosis in MDCK cells. Alternatively, hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis was not affected by NDGA. Thus, the TPA-induced response involved the mechanism independent of the oxidative stress. Obesity is a risk factor for severe diseases including noninsulin-dependent diabetes and atherosclerosis characterized by the changes of cell properties of adipocytes. We found that conjugated linolenic acid from bitter gourd was able to induce apoptosis in mouse preadipogenic 3T3-L1 cells.

Components of bitter melon extract appear to have structural similarities to animal insulin. Antiviral and antineoplastic activities have also been reported in vitro. Four clinical trials found bitter melon juice, fruit, and dried powder to have a moderate hypoglycemic effect. These studies were small and were not randomized or double-blind, however. Reported adverse effects of bitter melon include hypoglycemic coma and convulsions in children, reduced fertility in mice, a favism-like syndrome, increases in gamma-glutamyltransferase and alkaline phosphatase levels in animals, and headaches. Bitter melon may have additive effects when taken with other glucose-lowering agents. Adequately powered, randomized, placebo-controlled trials are needed to properly assess safety and efficacy before bitter melon can be routinely recommended.

        "Vinegar is generally believed to be good for health. A mash consisting of 35% ethanolic extract from bitter melon malt vinegar-water (8:50:42) was subjected to further acetate fermentation and the resulting vinegar was converted to dried vinegar powder by spray drying after adsorption on dextrin, which was mixed with a commercial rat chow (CRF-1) in the ratio of 1:19 so as to prepare an experimental diet. Male 12-wk old rats of LETO and OLETF strains were fed this experimental diet in parallel with CRF-1 (control) and examined for respiratory quotient (RQ) and blood or plasma parameters associated with diabetes mellitus. Administration of the experimental diet increased daily food intake as well as daily energy expenditure in both strains. RQ significantly lessened in the vinegar diet-fed group of LETO strain, which was reflected not only in the increased energy consumption from fat but also in the decreased energy consumption from carbohydrate, while no significant difference was observed between both dietary groups of OLETF strain in this respect. The profiles of diurnal energy expenditure in both dietary groups of LETO strain exerted two peaks before lights-on and lights-off. Nevertheless, there was a clear difference between both dietary groups of OLETF strain: interestingly the reproduction of the two peaks became conspicuous in the vinegar diet-fed group despite the lack of such peaks in the control. As a consequence of blood or plasma inspection, it turned out that there was no change in HbA1c but a significant increase in plasma cholesterol in the vinegar diet-fed OLETF rats. From these results, a long-term administration of bitter melon malt vinegar can be expected to suppress a lowering of energy turnover inherent with aging and thereby improve anorexia rather than to bring about a preventive effect against the manifestation of NIDDM.",

We compared the ability of a specific extract labeled fraction SX, as well as whole Maitake powder, fraction ES and fraction D of Maitake to influence SBP and various pertinent biochemical parameters when given orally to Zucker Fatty rats, a model of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. A secondary gain was the ability to ascertain the effects of bitter melon, olive oil, and sesame oil alone and combined with fraction SX to influence SBP. We found that a water-soluble fraction obtained from Maitake mushroom (SX) lowers SBP and fasting blood glucose significantly over the three to six weeks of study. While whole Maitake fraction lowered SBP effectively, the effects on fasting blood sugar were not apparent under the conditions of study. In contrast to fraction SX and fraction D, developed primarily to enhance immunity and suppress tumor development and growth, has essentially no effect on SBP under the conditions examined. An ether soluble fraction designated ES lowers SBP significantly. Interestingly, olive oil, unlike sesame oil, also lowers SBP. Finally, bitter melon and a combination of SX plus bitter melon also lower SBP.

        "There is considerable need for safe agents that can reduce risk for diabetes in at-risk subjects. Although certain drugs--including metformin, acarbose, and orlistat--have shown diabetes-preventive activity in large randomized studies, nutraceuticals have potential in this regard as well. Natural agents which slow carbohydrate absorption may mimic the protective effect of acarbose; these include: soluble fiber--most notably glucomannan; chlorogenic acid--likely responsible for reduction in diabetes risk associated with heavy coffee intake; and legume-derived alpha-amylase inhibitors. There does not appear to be a natural lipase inhibitor functionally equivalent to orlistat, although there are poorly documented claims for Cassia nomame extracts. Metformin's efficacy reflects activation of AMP-activated kinase; there is preliminary evidence that certain compounds in barley malt have similar activity, without the side effects associated with metformin. In supraphysiological concentrations, biotin directly activates soluble guanylate cyclase; this implies that, at some sufficient intake, biotin should exert effects on beta cells, the liver, and skeletal muscle that favor good glucose tolerance and maintenance of effective beta cell function. Good magnesium status is associated with reduced diabetes risk and superior insulin sensitivity in recent epidemiology; ample intakes of chromium picolinate appear to promote insulin sensitivity in many individuals and improve glycemic control in some diabetics; calcium/vitamin D may help preserve insulin sensitivity by preventing secondary hyperparathyroidism. Although conjugated linoleic acid--like thiazolidinediones, a PPAR-gamma agonist--has not aided insulin sensitivity in clinical trials, the natural rexinoid phytanic acid exerts thiazolidinedione-like effect in animals and cell cultures, and merits clinical examination. Other natural agents with the potential to treat and possibly prevent diabetes include extracts of bitter melon and of cinnamon. Nutraceuticals featuring meaningful doses of combinations of these agents would likely have substantial diabetes-preventive efficacy, and presumably could be marketed legally as aids to good glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity.",

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We found no study that assessed Ayurvedic as a system of care. Botanical therapy was by far the most commonly studied Ayurvedic treatment. Herbs were studied either singly or as formulas. In all, 993 titles in Western computerized databases and 318 titles identified by hand-searching journals in India were examined, yielding 54 articles reporting the results of 62 studies. The most-studied herbs were G sylvestre, C indica, fenugreek, and Eugenia jambolana. A number of herbal formulas were tested, but Ayush-82 and D-400 were most often studied. Thirty-five of the studies included came from the Western literature, 27 from the Indian. Seven were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 10 controlled clinical trials (CCTs) or natural experiments. Twenty-two studies went on to further analysis based on a set of criteria. Of these, 10 were RCTs, CCTs, or natural experiments, 12 were case series or cohort studies. There is evidence to suggest that the herbs C indica, holy basil, fenugreek, and G sylvestre, and the herbal formulas Ayush-82 and D-400 have a glucose-lowering effect and deserve further study. Evidence of effectiveness of several other herbs is less extensive (C tamala, E jambolana, and Momordica charantia). CONCLUSIONS: There is heterogeneity in the available literature on Ayurvedic treatment for diabetes. Most studies test herbal therapy. Heterogeneity exists in the herbs and formulas tested (more than 44 different interventions identified) and in the method of their preparation. Despite these limitations, there are sufficient data for several herbs or herbal formulas to warrant further studies.",

Insulin resistance is characterized by significant down-regulation of hepatic insulin signalling as documented by attenuated phosphorylation of insulin receptor (IR), IR substrates 1 and 2, phosphoinositide-3 kinase, protein kinase B, and over-expression of phosphotyrosine phosphatase 1B. We recently demonstrated that bitter melon juice (BMJ) is a potent inhibitor of apoB secretion and TAG synthesis and secretion in human hepatoma cells, HepG2, that may be involved in plasma lipid- and VLDL-lowering effects observed in animal studies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of BMJ on plasma apoB levels and hepatic insulin signalling cascade in mice fed high-fat diet (HFD). Female C57BL/6 mice (4-6 weeks old) were randomized into three groups receiving regular rodent chow, HFD and HFD+BMJ. The data indicate that BMJ not only improves glucose and insulin tolerance but also lowers plasma apoB-100 and apoB-48 in HFD-fed mice as well as modulates the phosphorylation status of IR and its downstream signalling molecules. Investigating the biochemical and molecular mechanisms involved in amelioration of diabetic dyslipidaemia by BMJ may lead to identification of new molecular targets for dietary/alternative therapies.",

        2008,
        "Treatment of insulin resistance is a critical strategy in the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes. The crude extracts from all parts of Momordica charantia L. have been reported by many studies for the effective treatment of diabetes and related complications. However, the exact ingredients responsible for the hypoglycemic effect and the underlying mechanism of their actions have not been well characterized because of the lack of a proper assay and screening system. A new cell-based, nonradioactive, and nonfluorescent screening method was demonstrated in this study to screen for natural products from the stem of M. charantia, aiming to identify hypoglycemic components that can overcome cellular insulin resistance. The results suggest triterpenoids being potential hypoglycemic components of the plant and the mechanism underlying their action involving AMP-activated protein kinase.",

        "Although corroborating data indicate that estrogens influence glucose metabolism through the activation of the estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), it has not been established whether this pathway could represent an effective therapeutic target to fight against metabolic disturbances induced by a high-fat diet (HFD). To this end, we first evaluated the influence of chronic 17beta-estradiol (E2) administration in wild-type ovariectomized mice submitted to either a normal chow diet or a HFD. Whereas only a modest effect was observed in normal chow diet-fed mice, E2 administration exerted a protective effect against HFD-induced glucose intolerance, and this beneficial action was abolished in ERalpha-deficient mice. Furthermore, E2 treatment reduced HFD-induced insulin resistance by 50% during hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp studies and improved insulin signaling (Akt phosphorylation) in insulin-stimulated skeletal muscles. Unexpectedly, we found that E2 treatment enhanced cytokine (IL-6, TNF-alpha) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 mRNA expression induced by HFD in the liver and visceral adipose tissue. Interestingly, although the proinflammatory effect of E2 was abolished in visceral adipose tissue from chimeric mice grafted with bone marrow cells from ERalpha-deficient mice, the beneficial effect of the hormone on glucose tolerance was not altered, suggesting that the metabolic and inflammatory effects of estrogens can be dissociated. Eventually comparison of sham-operated with ovariectomized HFD-fed mice demonstrated that endogenous estrogens levels are sufficient to exert a full protective effect against insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. In conclusion, the regulation of the ERalpha pathway could represent an effective strategy to reduce the impact of high-fat diet-induced type 2 diabetes.",

        2009,
        "OBJECTIVE: To review clinical evidence supporting complementary and alternative medicine interventions for improving glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus. QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched from January 1966 to August 2008 using the term type 2 diabetes in combination with each of the following terms for specific therapies selected by the authors: cinnamon, fenugreek, gymnema, green tea, fibre, momordica, chromium, and vanadium. Only human clinical trials were selected for review. MAIN MESSAGE: Chromium reduced glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) and fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels in a large meta-analysis. Gymnema sylvestre reduced HbA(1c) levels in 2 small open-label trials. Cinnamon improved FBG but its effects on HbA(1c) are unknown. Bitter melon had no effect in 2 small trials. Fibre had no consistent effect on HbA(1c) or FBG in 12 small trials. Green tea reduced FBG levels in 1 of 3 small trials. Fenugreek reduced FBG in 1 of 3 small trials. Vanadium reduced FBG in small, uncontrolled trials. There were no trials evaluating microvascular or macrovascular complications or other clinical end points. CONCLUSION: Chromium, and possibly gymnema, appears to improve glycemic control. Fibre, green tea, and fenugreek have other benefits but there is little evidence that they substantially improve glycemic control. Further research on bitter melon and cinnamon is warranted. There is no complementary and alternative medicine research addressing microvascular or macrovascular clinical outcomes.",

Among Bitter melon extracts compounds, we focused on an extract known as momordin in the present study, to examine its effect on peroxisome-proliferator activated-receptor (PPAR) delta (also called PPARdelta in rodents) expression and promoter activity of the human PPARdelta gene. METHODS: A human PPARdelta promoter-reporter plasmid was made as a template from a BAC CLONE (RPCI-11C) containing a -3076 bp (BglI site) +74 bp (EcoRI site) sequence. Luciferase assay of PPARdelta promoter activity was performed using HepG2 cells. RESULTS: 10 and 25 nM Momordin significantly increased the expression of PPARdelta mRNA 1.5-fold (relative to the control). Moreover, 10 and 25 nM Momordin significantly increased PPARdelta promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner, reaching more than 1.5-fold relative to the control. CONCLUSION: Our present data obtained through successful cloning of the PPARdelta promoter demonstrate that PPARdelta production and activation are upregulated through PPARdelta promoter activity following momordin treatment.",

        "BACKGROUND: Escalating trends of obesity and associated type 2 diabetes (T2D) has prompted an increase in the use of alternative and complementary functional foods. Momordica charantia or bitter melon (BM) that is traditionally used to treat diabetes and complications has been demonstrated to alleviate hyperglycemia as well as reduce adiposity in rodents. However, its effects on human adipocytes remain unknown. The objective of our study was to investigate the effects of BM juice (BMJ) on lipid accumulation and adipocyte differentiation transcription factors in primary human differentiating preadipocytes and adipocytes. METHODS: Commercially available cryopreserved primary human preadipocytes were treated with and without BMJ during and after differentiation. Cytotoxicity, lipid accumulation, and adipogenic genes mRNA expression was measured by commercial enzymatic assay kits and semi-quantitative RT-PCR (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Preadipocytes treated with varying concentrations of BMJ during differentiation demonstrated significant reduction in lipid content with a concomitant reduction in mRNA expression of adipocyte transcription factors such as, peroxisome proliferator-associated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) and adipocytokine, resistin. Similarly, adipocytes treated with BMJ for 48 h demonstrated reduced lipid content, perilipin mRNA expression, and increased lipolysis as measured by the release of glycerol. CONCLUSION: Our data suggests that BMJ is a potent inhibitor of lipogenesis and stimulator of lipolysis activity in human adipocytes. BMJ may therefore prove to be an effective complementary or alternative therapy to reduce adipogenesis in humans.",

Traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) are usually served as adjuvants used to improve diabetic syndromes in combination of routine antidiabetic drugs. For single-herb prescriptions, Ginseng, Bitter melon, Golden Thread, Fenugreek, Garlic, and Cinnamon might have antidiabetic effects in T2DM patients.

Their action mechanisms are related to improve insulin sensitivity, stimulate insulin secretion, protect pancreatic islets, and even inhibit intake of intestinal carbohydrates. However, it is very difficult to determine antihyperglycemic components of TCM. Nevertheless, TCM are becoming popular complementary and alternative medicine in treatment of syndromes of T2DM. In the future, it requires further validation of phytochemical, pharmacological, and clinical natures of TCM in T2DM in the future studies, especially for those herbs with a high prescription frequency.",

        "Hyperglycemia is a pathological condition associated with prediabetes and diabetes. The incidence of prediabetes and diabetes is increasing and imposes great burden on healthcare worldwide. Patients with prediabetes and diabetes have significantly increased risk for cardiovascular diseases and other complications. Currently, management of hyperglycemia includes pharmacological interventions, physical exercise, and change of life style and diet. Food supplements have increasingly become attractive alternatives to prevent or treat hyperglycemia, especially for subjects with mild hyperglycemia. This review summarized current patents and patent applications with relevant literature on five commonly used food supplements with claims of hypoglycemic effects, including emblica officinalis (gooseberry), fenugreek, green tea, momordica charantia (bitter melon) and cinnamon. The data from human clinical studies did not support a recommendation for all five supplements to manage hyperglycemia. Fenugreek and composite supplements containing emblica officinalis showed the most consistency in lowering fasting blood sugar (FBS) or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels in diabetic patients. The hypoglycemic effects of cinnamon and momordica charantia were demonstrated in most of the trials with some exceptions. However, green tea exhibited limited benefits in reducing FBS or HbA1c levels and should not be recommended for managing hyperglycemia. Certain limitations are noticed in a considerable number of clinical studies including small sample size, poor experimental design and considerable variations in participant population, preparation format, daily dose, and treatment duration. Future studies with more defined participants, standardized preparation and dose, and improved trial design and size are warranted.",

Only FF and AM extracts/fractions were found to inhibit alpha-amylase activity significantly (P < 0.05) and coparable to the drug acarbose. Amylase bioassay on isolated mouse plasma confirmed the inhibitory potential of AM and FF extracts with the ethyl acetate fraction of FF being more potent (P < 0.05) than acarbose. Extracts/fractions of AM and MC were found to inhibit significantly (P < 0.05) alpha-glucosidase activity, with IC(50) comparable to the drug 1-deoxynojirimycin. In vivo studies on glycogen-loaded mice showed significant (P < 0.05) depressive effect on elevation of postprandial blood glucose following ingestion of AM and MC extracts.

C.Jeffrey -Asteraceae (FF), Momordica charantia Linn -Cucurbitaceae (MC) and Ocimum tenuiflorum L -Lamiaceae (OT) were evaluated for their antioxidant, antiglycation and cytotoxic potential in vitro. METHODS: Graded concentrations (1.25-100 mug/mL) of the crude methanolic and water extracts and fractions (dichloromethane, ethyl-acetate, n-butanol and water) were evaluated for abilities to scavenge 2,2-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl hydrate (DPPH), nitric oxide (NO), superoxide (SO) radicals and to inhibit lipoxygenase and formation of advanced glycation endproduct (AGE) in vitro. The MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethylthazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazonium bromide) cytotoxicity test was performed on 3T3 cell line. RESULTS: Only IC50 for DPPH, SO, NO and lipoxygenase for AM, FF and OT crude extracts and fractions were comparable to ascorbic acid and quercetin activity. Crude aqueous extracts of AM and FF showed IC50 of 4.08 and 3.89 mug/mL respectively for lipoxygenase which was significantly lower (p < 0.05) than quercetin (10.86 +/- 0.68 mug/mL). The three crude aqueous extracts of these plants and their n-butanol fractions also showed antiglycation activities (p < 0.05) comparable to aminoguanidine. Increasing concentrations (250-2000 mug/mL) of the six crude extracts (Methanol and water) and their fractions did not inhibit mitochondrial respiration as measured by MTT cytotoxicity assay. CONCLUSION: AM, FF and OT crude extracts and fractions have potent antioxidant and antiglycation properties with no apparent cytotoxicity and might have prophylactic and therapeutic potentials in the management of diabetes and related complications.

        2012,
        "The ancestral status of estrogen receptor (ER) in the family of the steroid receptors has probably contributed to the pleiotropic actions of estrogens, and in particular of 17beta-estradiol (E2). Indeed, in addition to their well described role in sexual development and reproduction, they influence most of the physiological processes. The pathophysiological counterpart of these actions includes several highly beneficial effects such as prevention of osteoporosis, atheroma and type 2 diabetes,... However, estrogens also promotes two deleterious actions : the stimulation of the proliferation of the epithelium of two sex targets : uterus and breast, favoring an increase in risk of epithelial cancer in these two tissues. These actions are mediated by the activation of ER alpha (ERalpha) and beta (ERbeta), which regulate target gene transcription (genomic action) through two independent activation functions AF-1 and AF-2, but can also elicit rapid membrane initiated steroid signals. Although ERbeta plays an important role in the central nervous system and in the heart, ERalpha appears to play a prominent role in most of the other tissues. One major challenge consists in uncoupling some beneficial actions from other deleterious ones, i.e. selective ER modulation. Tamoxifen and raloxifen are beneficial to prevent the recurrence of breast cancer, and mimic estrogen action mainly on bone, but their effets on atheroma and on type 2 diabetes are if any marginal. These last years, several labs, and in particular our lab, have attempted: 1) To perform an in vivo molecular \"dissection\" of ER alpha, allowing the uncoupling of some of its actions, and potentially paving the way to optimized selective ER modulators. (reviewed in Arnal JF, et al. Br J Pharmacol. 2012;165:57-66). 2) To describe an unexpected action of E2 treatment at the level of platelet responses in mice, that protects the animals from thromboembolism through the haematopoietic ER alpha.

Hormonal contraception has only a modest impact on lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, but estrogen-progestin contraceptives have been linked to a variety of vascular risks. Overall, the risk of venous thrombosis is multiplied by a factor of about 4, depending on age, the compounds used, and other risk factors (including biological thrombophilia and a personal history of thrombosis), whereas the risk of arterial events is only increased in women with risk factors. Available data suggest there is no excess risk with progestin-based contraceptives, but far fewer studies have been conducted. At the initiative of the French Society of Endocrinology, an expert group met in 2010 in order to reach a consensus on the use of hormonal contraceptive methods in women with vascular or metabolic risk factors, based on available data and international guidelines published by WHO in 2009 and subsequently adapted to the United States context. The following text, intentionally limited to hormonal contraception, is intended to serve as a guide when prescribing in specific clinical situations, such as a family or personal history of arterial or venous thromboembolism, or the existence of cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, smoking, diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity).",

This review emphasizes the urgent need to improve the use of contraception in women with diabetes. There is no consistent evidence that combined oral contraceptives significantly influence the risk of developing diabetes, even in women with a history of gestational diabetes. Furthermore, although data from specific studies remain sparse, no worsening effect has been reported in diabetic women, either in glycemic control or on the course of microvascular complications. Thus, the use of estroprogestive pills is now recognized as a safe and effective option for preconception care of women with uncomplicated diabetes. According to recent guidelines, these contraceptives must be avoided in case of associated cardiovascular risk factors, cardiovascular disease or severe microvascular complications such as nephropathy with proteinuria or active proliferative retinopathy. Prescription of combined hormonal contraception in type 2 diabetic women must also be considered with caution due to a frequent association with obesity and vascular risk factors which increase both thromboembolic and arterial risks.

This study seeks to understand the prevalence, types, expenditures, attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions of CAM use among patients with DM visiting outpatient primary care clinics. METHODS: This is a descriptive, cross-sectional study of 240 diabetic patients. CAM is defined as a group of diverse medical and healthcare systems, practices, and products that are not generally considered part of conventional Western medicine. Data analysis was done using SPSS v. 19 and multiple logistic regressions were used to identify predictors of CAM use. RESULTS: The prevalence of CAM use was 62.5 percent. Female were 1.8 times more likely than male in using CAM. Malays (75%) were the most frequent users, followed Indians (18%) and Chinese (6%). Biological therapy (50.0%) were the most widely used, followed by manipulative-body based systems (9.2%), energy system (8.8%), alternative medicine systems (4.6%) and mind-body system (1.7%).

Blood samples were collected according to glycemic status: normoglycemic (N = 56) and hyperglycemic (N = 26). General and hematological characteristics were determined. Blood rheological parameters were determined at room temperature and under a temperature scan. We determined the effects on whole blood viscosity of treatment with an extract of M. charantia, PEG, or PEG microspheres adsorbed with plant extract. The viscosity of the blood of hyperglycemic patients is greater than that of normoglycemic patients. Nanoparticles of M. charantia extracts lowered blood viscosity at equivalent rates in normo- and hyperglycemic individuals. PEG microspheres did not reduce blood viscosity in hyperglycemic individuals. However, PEG microspheres adsorbed with nanofraction extracts of M. charantia reduced blood viscosity. These data suggest that the effects of diabetes on the viscosity of the blood should be considered. The use of a nanoparticles extract of M. charantia and its adsorption on PEG microspheres may represent an alternative for the control and treatment of blood disorders in diabetic patients.",

        2014,
        "OBJECTIVE: Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) plays an important role in wound healing. Delayed wound healing is a consequence of diabetes, leading to high morbidity and poor quality of life. Momordica charantia (MC) fruit possesses anti-diabetic and wound healing properties. This study aimed to explore the changes in TGF-beta expression in diabetic wounds treated with topical MC fruit extract. METHODS: Fifty-six male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into a normal control group and five diabetic groups of ten rats each. Intravenous streptozotocin (50mg/kg) was given to induce diabetes in the diabetic groups. Full thickness excision wounds were created on the thoracodorsal region of the animals, and these wounds were then treated with vehicle, MC powder, MC ointment and povidone ointment or ointment base for ten days. Wound healing was determined by the rate of wound closure, total protein content and TGF-beta expression in the wounds, and histological observation. RESULTS: Diabetic groups showed delayed wound closure rates compared to the control group. The wound closure rate in the MC ointment group was significantly faster than that of the untreated diabetic group (p<0.05). The MC ointment group also showed intense TGF-beta expression and a high level of total protein content. CONCLUSION: MC ointment has a promising potential for use as an alternative topical medication for diabetic wounds. This work has shown that it accelerates wound healing in diabetic rats, and it is suggested here that this occurs by enhancing TGF-beta expression. Further work is recommended to explore this effect.",

        2014,
        "Diabetes, a common metabolic disorder, is characterized by hyperglycemia. Insulin is the principal mediator of glucose homeostasis. In a previous study, we identified a trypsin inhibitor, named Momordica charantia insulin receptor (IR)-binding protein (mcIRBP) in this study, that might interact with IR. The physical and functional interactions between mcIRBP and IR were clearly analyzed in the present study. Photo-cross-linking coupled with mass spectrometry showed that three regions (17-21, 34-40, and 59-66 residues) located on mcIRBP physically interacted with leucine-rich repeat domain and cysteine-rich region of IR. IR-binding assay showed that the binding behavior of mcIRBP and insulin displayed a cooperative manner. After binding to IR, mcIRBP activated the kinase activity of IR by (5.87 +/- 0.45)-fold, increased the amount of phospho-IR protein by (1.31 +/- 0.03)-fold, affected phosphoinositide-3-kinase/Akt pathways, and consequently stimulated the uptake of glucose in 3T3-L1 cells by (1.36 +/- 0.12)-fold. Intraperitoneal injection of 2.5 nmol/kg mcIRBP significantly decreased the blood glucose levels by 20.9 +/- 3.2% and 10.8 +/- 3.6% in normal and diabetic mice, respectively. Microarray analysis showed that mcIRBP affected genes involved in insulin signaling transduction pathway in mice. In conclusion, our findings suggest that mcIRBP is a novel IRBP that binds to sites different from the insulin-binding sites on IR and stimulates both the glucose uptake in cells and the glucose clearance in mice.",

        "INTRODUCTION: Diabetes mellitus is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with a prevalence of 347 million in 2013. Complementary and Alternative Medicines (CAM) are a group of remedies that is fast gaining acceptance among individuals. Cinnamon, Bitter gourd (Momordica charantia) and Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum) are 3 widely used CAMs used worldwide for the treatment of diabetes. Data on safety and efficacy is limited, but the consumption is wide. Crepe ginger (Costus speciosus) and Ivy gourd (Coccinia grandis) are 2 plants used widely in the Asian region for their presumed hypoglycaemic properties. OBJECTIVE: In this review, we analyzed the available evidence for the 5 CAMs mentioned above in terms of in-vitro studies, animal studies sand clinical trials. We also describe the mechanisms of hypoglycaemia and safety concerns where there is available evidence. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Clinical trials that studied the hypoglycaemic effects of Cinnamon, bitter gourd, fenugreek and ivy gourd showed conflicting results. Direct comparison between studies remains a challenge in view of the baseline heterogeneity of subjects, differences in substrate preparation, variable end points and poor trial design. Short durations of study and small number of subjects studied is universal. Crepe ginger has not been studied adequately in humans to draw conclusions.In view of the high prevalence of use and safety and efficacy issues, there is an urgent need to study their hypoglycaemic and adverse effects in well-designed long-term clinical trials.",

        "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma is expressed in adipose tissue and plays a key role in the regulation of adipogenesis. PPARgamma activators are known to have potent antihyperglycemic activity and are used to treat insulin resistance associated with diabetes. Therefore, many natural and synthetic agonists of PPARgamma are used in the treatment of glucose disorders. In the present study, we found that 13-oxo-9(Z),11(E),15(Z)-octadecatrienoic acid (13-oxo-OTA), a linolenic acid derivative, is present in the extract of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), Mandarin orange (Citrus reticulata), and bitter gourd (Momordica charantia). We also found that 13-oxo-OTA activated PPARgamma and induced the mRNA expression of PPARgamma target genes in adipocytes, thereby promoting differentiation. Furthermore, 13-oxo-OTA induced secretion of adiponectin and stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report that 13-oxo-OTA induces adipogenesis through PPARgamma activation and to present 13-oxo-OTA as a valuable food-derived compound that may be applied in the management of glucose metabolism disorders.",

        "The life expectancy of women has risen in the past century from 48years to more than 80. The decline of endogenous estrogen production (in particular, the principal circulating physiological hormone, 17beta-estradiol) at menopause (which occurs at an average of 51years) is often accompanied by a series of functional disorders that affect quality of life (QoL). This estrogen deficiency affects different tissues and results in an increase in the prevalence of various disorders, including but not limited to osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. Hormone therapy for menopause is a relatively recent biomedical challenge, which underwent a downturn after the Women Health Initiative study of older postmenopausal women. We will summarize the WHI findings in the first part of this article. At Inserm unit 1048, we are working on understanding the protective effects of estrogen against the development of atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes in murine models. We have also focused in recent years on modeling the impact of estrogen in thrombosis models, to attempt to clarify the complex relation between estrogen and thrombotic risk. In part II of this article, we will describe a new strategy of hormone therapy for menopause, combining estrogens and selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM).

        2016,
        "UNLABELLED: Objective Acquired chemoresistance is a major obstacle in the clinical management of ovarian cancer. Therefore, searching for alternative therapeutic modalities is urgently needed. Bitter melon (Momordica charantia) is a traditional dietary fruit, but its extract also shows potential medicinal values in human diabetes and cancers. Here, we sought to investigate the extract of bitter melon (BME) in antitumorigenic and cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity in ovarian cancer cells. METHODS: Three varieties of bitter melon were used to prepare the BME. Ovarian cancer cell lines, human immortalized epithelial ovarian cells (HOSEs), and nude mice were used to evaluate the cell cytotoxicity, cisplatin resistance, and tumor inhibitory effect of BME. The molecular mechanism of BME was examined by Western blotting. RESULTS: Cotreatment with BME and cisplatin markedly attenuated tumor growth in vitro and in vivo in a mouse xenograft model, whereas there was no observable toxicity in HOSEs or in nude mice in vivo Interestingly, the antitumorigenic effects of BME varied with different varieties of bitter melon, suggesting that the amount of antitumorigenic substances may vary. Studies of the molecular mechanism demonstrated that BME activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in an AMP-independent but CaMKK (Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase)-dependent manner, exerting anticancer effects through activation of AMPK and suppression of the mTOR/p70S6K and/or the AKT/ERK/FOXM1 (Forkhead Box M1) signaling cascade. CONCLUSION: BME functions as a natural AMPK activator in the inhibition of ovarian cancer cell growth and might be useful as a supplement to improve the efficacy of cisplatin-based chemotherapy in ovarian cancer.",

        2016,
        "BACKGROUND: Patients with HNF1B mutations develop progressive chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus (40-50%), and liver tests abnormalities (40-70%). In HNF1B patients who reach end-stage renal disease, single kidney transplantation (SKT) or combined kidney-pancreas transplantation can be considered. METHODS: A retrospective multicenter study including 18 HNF1B patients receiving SKT or kidney-pancreas transplantation, and in vitro experiments including the characterization of the HNF1B expression after calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) exposure. RESULTS: After SKT, 50% of the HNF1B patients develop early posttransplantation diabetes mellitus, whereas 40% experience new-onset or severe worsening of preexisting abnormalities of liver tests, including severe cholestasis. In liver biopsies, disorders of the cholangiocytes primary cilium and various degrees of bile duct paucity and dysplasia were identified. In vitro studies combining CNI exposure and siRNA-mediated inhibition of NFATc revealed that calcineurin inhibition decreases HNF1B expression in epithelial cells but independent of NFATc. CONCLUSIONS: Because HNF1B-related disease is a heterozygous condition, CNIs used to prevent rejection may induce reduced expression of the nonmutated allele of HNF1B leading to a superimposed defect of HNF-1beta transcriptional activity. Taking into account the specific risk of posttransplantation diabetes mellitus and liver disorders in HNF1B patients, these findings advocate for in-depth characterization of pathways that regulate HNF1B and plead for considering individually tailored graft management that may include a CNI-free immunosuppressive regimen. Interventional studies will have to confirm this individualized approach.",

Additionally, BLSP significantly suppressed the activation of MAPK (JNK and p38). The results indicate that BLSP can significantly modify the proportions of particular gut microbiota in diabetic rats without disturbing the normal population diversity.

        2016,
        "Recently, there is a paradigm shift that the whole food-derived components are not 'idle bystanders' but actively participate in modulating aberrant metabolic and signaling pathways in both healthy and diseased individuals. One such whole food from Cucurbitaceae family is 'bitter melon' (Momordica charantia, also called bitter gourd, balsam apple, etc.), which has gained an enormous attention in recent years as an alternative medicine in developed countries. The increased focus on bitter melon consumption could in part be due to several recent pre-clinical efficacy studies demonstrating bitter melon potential to target obesity/type II diabetes-associated metabolic aberrations as well as its pre-clinical anti-cancer efficacy against various malignancies. The bioassay-guided fractionations have also classified the bitter melon chemical constituents based on their anti-diabetic or cytotoxic effects. Thus, by definition, these bitter melon constituents are at cross roads on the bioactivity parameters; they either have selective efficacy for correcting metabolic aberrations or targeting cancer cells, or have beneficial effects in both conditions. However, given the vast, though dispersed, literature reports on the bioactivity and beneficial attributes of bitter melon constituents, a comprehensive review on the bitter melon components and the overlapping beneficial attributes is lacking; our review attempts to fulfill these unmet needs. Importantly, the recent realization that there are common risk factors associated with obesity/type II diabetes-associated metabolic aberrations and cancer, this timely review focuses on the dual efficacy of bitter melon against the risk factors associated with both diseases that could potentially impact the course of malignancy to advanced stages. Furthermore, this review also addresses a significant gap in our knowledge regarding the bitter melon drug-drug interactions which can be predicted from the available reports on bitter melon effects on metabolism enzymes and drug transporters. This has important implications, given that a large proportion of individuals, taking bitter melon based supplements/phytochemical extracts/food based home-remedies, are also likely to be taking conventional therapeutic drugs at the same time. Accordingly, the comprehensively reviewed information here could be prudently translated to the clinical implications associated with any potential concerns regarding bitter melon consumption by cancer patients.",

Alteration in Pgp expression was evaluated by real-time-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting while modulation in activity of Pgp was evaluated using rhodamine 123 (Rh123) as transport substrate by in-situ absorption and everted gut sac method. RESULTS: In PHF, pretreated group received 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg/day for 7 days, mRNA level decreased by 1.75, 2.45 and 2.37-fold, respectively, as compared to control.

Pgp mediated transport of Rh123 was significantly decreased with everted gut sac prepared from PHF pretreated rats (1 week) compared to those prepared from vehicle treated rats. CONCLUSIONS: We report that PHF pretreatment downregulated the expression of intestinal Pgp and this downregulated intestinal Pgp would result in decreased functional activity.

Humans seek for safe herbal medication such as karela (Momordica charantia/bitter melon) to treat such disorders to avoid side effect of pharmacotherapies widely used. METHODS: Forty male Wistar rats were divided into four equal groups; control group with free access to food and water, cholesterol administered group (40 mg/kg BW orally); karela administered group (5 g /kg BW orally) and mixture of cholesterol and karela. The treatments continued for 10 weeks. Karela was given for hypercholesterolemic rats after 6 weeks of cholesterol administration. Serum, liver and epididymal adipose tissues were taken for biochemical, histopathological and genetic assessments. RESULTS: Hypercholesterolemia induced a decrease in serum superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, reduced glutathione (GSH) and an increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels that were ameliorated by karela administration. Hypercholesterolemia up regulated antioxidants mRNA expression and altered the expression of carbohydrate metabolism genes. In parallel, hypercholesterolemic groups showed significant changes in the expression of PPAR-alpha and gamma, lipolysis, lipogenesis and cholesterol metabolism such as carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1). Acyl CoA oxidase (ACO), fatty acids synthase (FAS), sterol responsible element binding protein-1c (SREBP1c), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoAR) and cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) at hepatic and adipose tissue levels. Interestingly, Karela ameliorated all altered genes confirming its hypocholesterolemic effect. Histopathological and immunohistochemical findings revealed that hypercholesterolemia induced hepatic tissue changes compared with control. These changes include cholesterol clefts, necrosis, karyolysis and sever congestion of portal blood vessel. Caspase-3 immunoreactivity showed positive expression in hepatic cells of hypercholesterolemic rats compared to control. All were counteracted and normalized after Karela administration to hypercholesterolemic group. CONCLUSION: Current findings confirmed that karela is a potential supplement useful in treatment of hypercholesterolemia and its associated disorders and is good for human health.",

Several vitamins, minerals, botanicals, and secondary metabolites have been reported to elicit beneficial effects in hypoglycemic actions in vivo and in vitro; however, the data remain conflicting. Many pharmaceuticals commonly used today are structurally derived from natural compounds from traditional medicinal plants. Botanicals that are most frequently used to help manage blood glucose include: bitter melon (Momordica charantia), fenugreek (Trigonella foenum graecum), gurmar (Gymnema sylvestre), ivy gourd (Coccinia indica), nopal (Opuntia spp.), ginseng, Russian tarragon (Artemisia dracunculus), cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia), psyllium (Plantago ovata), and garlic (Allium sativum). In majority of the herbal products and secondary metabolites used in treating diabetes, the mechanisms of action involve regulation of insulin signaling pathways, translocation of GLUT-4 receptor and/or activation the PPARgamma. Several flavonoids inhibit glucose absorption by inhibiting intestinal alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase. In-depth studies to validate the efficacies and safeties of extracts of these traditional medicinal plants are needed, and large, well designed, clinical studies need to be carried out before the use of such preparations can be recommended for treatment and/or prevention of diabetes. The main focus of this review is to describe what we know to date of the active compounds in these, along with their glucose-lowering mechanisms, which are either through insulin-mimicking activity or enhanced glucose uptake.",

        2017,
        "BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus (DM) has been one of the most common chronic diseases that create great impacts on both morbidities and mortalities. Many patients who suffering from this disease seek for complementary and alternative medicine. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and related factors of herbal and dietary supplement (HDS) use in patients with DM type 2 at a single university hospital in Thailand. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed in 200 type 2 DM patients via face-to-face structured interviews using developed questionnaires comprised of demographic data, diabetes-specific information, details on HDS use, and medical adherence. RESULTS: From the endocrinology clinic, 61% of total patients reported HDS exposure and 28% were currently consuming. More than two-thirds of HDS users did not notify their physicians, mainly because of a lack of doctor concern; 73% of cases had no awareness of potential drug-herb interaction. The use of drumstick tree, turmeric and bitter gourd and holy mushroom were most frequently reported. The main reasons for HDS use were friend and relative suggestions and social media. Comparisons of demographic characteristics, medical adherence, and hemoglobin A1c among these non-HDS users, as well as current and former users, were not statistically significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed a great number of DM patients interested in HDS use. The use of HDS for glycemic control is an emerging public health concern given the potential adverse effects, drug interactions and benefits associated with its use. Health care professionals should aware of HDS use and hence incorporate this aspect into the clinical practice.",

        2017,
        "CONTEXT: Momordica charantia L. (Cucurbitaceae) has long been widely used as a traditional remedy for diabetes mellitus in some countries. However, detailed antidiabetic mechanisms are largely unknown. OBJECTIVES: This study clarified the ameliorating effects of M. charantia ethanol extracts (MCE) on the insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: T2DM rat model was established by high-fat diet and streptozotocin (STZ) injection. Diabetic rats were randomized into five groups: the model control group (n = 8) (common diet), the high-fat diet metformin (50 mg/kg/d), and the three-dose MCE (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg/d) groups (n = 8 each). After 8 weeks, the fasting serum glucose, insulin, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 were measured, and the relevant factors of glucose and insulin were monitored by glycogen dyeing, RT-PCR, and western blot, respectively. RESULTS: The 8-week treatment of 400 mg/kg MCE significantly lowered body weight (330.1 versus 365.9 g), serum glucose (7.41 versus 16.63 mmol/L), insulin (12.06 versus 15.89 mIU/L), TNF-alpha (52.72 versus 81.83 ng/L), and IL-6 (104.81 versus 135.74 ng/L) in comparison with those of the diabetic control group (p < 0.05). It was the same for skeletal muscle glucose transporter 4 (GLUT-4) protein, and glycogen level, suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and Akt expression at both protein and mRNA levels in liver (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: MCE can ameliorate insulin resistance in T2DM rats. This effect may be related to the regulation of mRNA and protein levels of SOCS-3 and JNK.",

Although many drugs have been developed and used to treat diabetes, side effects and long-term efficacy are of great challenge. Therefore, natural health product and dietary supplements have been of increasing interest alternatively. In this regard, Chinese herbs and herbal products have been considered a rich resource of product development.

        "glucose - Bitter gourd reduces elevated fasting plasma glucose levels in an intervention study among prediabetics in Tanzania.",
        2018,
        "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes mellitus have become major health issues even in non-industrialized countries. As access to clinical management is often poor, dietary interventions and alternative medicines are required. For bitter gourd, Momordica charantia L., antidiabetic properties have been claimed. AIM OF THE STUDY: The main objective of the intervention study was to assess antidiabetic effects of daily bitter gourd consumption of 2.5g powder over the course of eight weeks among prediabetic individuals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a randomized placebo-controlled single blinded clinical trial, 52 individuals with prediabetes were studied after consuming a bitter gourd or a cucumber juice. For reducing the impact of between subject differences in the study population, a crossover design was chosen with eight weeks for each study period and four weeks washout in between. Fasting plasma glucose was chosen as the primary outcome variable. RESULTS: Comparing the different exposures, the CROS analysis (t=-2.23, p=0.031, r=0.326) revealed a significant difference in the change of FPG of 0.31mmol/L (5.6mg/dL) with a trend (R(2)=0,42387). The number of 44 finally complete data sets achieved a power of 0.82, with a medium-to-large effect size (Cohen's d 0.62). The effect was also proven by a general linear mixed model (estimate 0.31; SE: 0.12; p: 0.01; 95%CI: 0.08; 0.54). Not all participants responded, but the higher the initial blood glucose levels were, the more pronounced the effect was. No serious adverse effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Bitter gourd supplementation appeared to have benefits in lowering elevated fasting plasma glucose in prediabetes. The findings should be replicated in other intervention studies to further investigate glucose lowering effects and the opportunity to use bitter gourd for dietary self-management, especially in places where access to professional medical care is not easily assured.",

        "lipid - An in vitro and in vivo study of a 4-herb formula on the management of diet-induced metabolic syndrome.",
        2018,
        "BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome is the cluster of risk factors that leads to increased episodes of cardiovascular disease (CVD). These risk factors include but are not limited to obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD), dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. Since the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome has multiple metabolic origins, there is no single treatment for it. Pharmacological approaches consist of separate drugs which target at individual risk factors which pose various side effects. Functional foods or nutraceuticals which have potentially important anti-obesity properties have thus attracted great attention. Schisandrae Fructus is a Chinese herb traditionally used as a liver tonic. Silymarin, an extract of the milk thistle (Silybum marianum), is a dietary supplement that is widely used in western society for the prevention and treatment of liver problems. Crataegus Fructus (hawthorn) is traditionally used to promote digestion and dissipate food stagnation. Momordica charantia (bitter melon) is traditionally used for treatment of diabetes in Ayurvedic Medicine. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: We aimed to develop a multi-targeted herbal formula to target on the multiple risk factors of metabolic syndrome using individual herbs. This proposed herbal formula include sylimarin and Schisandrae Fructus, for NAFLD; Crataegus Fructus for obesity and hyperlipidemia; and Momordica charantia for hyperglycemia. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: For in vitro study, we carried out insulin-induced 3T3-L1 adipocytes differentiation and fluorescent tagged cholesterol-treated Caco-2 cell assay to study for adipogenesis and cholesterol uptake into Caco-2 cells, respectively. Oleic acid-induced HepG2 cell assay was used to study for oleic acid-induced fatty liver, and brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) assay was used to study for glucose uptake from the gut. For in vivo study, we performed an 8-week and a 12-week treatment studies, with each study comprising of 4 groups of C57Bl/6 male mice given: (i) Normal-chow diet; (ii)-(iv) High-fat diet (contains 21% fat and 0.15% cholesterol). After the initial 8 weeks of normal chow or high-fat diet feeding to induce obesity, animals were given: (i) Normal-chow diet; (ii) High-fat diet; (iii) High-fat diet+2% herbal formula; or (iv) High-fat diet+4% herbal formula as treatment for another 8 weeks or 12 weeks. RESULTS: Our in vitro results suggested Crataegus Fructus aqueous extract exerted potent inhibitory effects on 3T3-L1 preadipocytes differentiation and cholesterol uptake into Caco-2 cells. Schisandrae Fructus aqueous extract and milk thistle exerted inhibitory effects on oleic acid-induced fatty liver in HepG2 cells. Momordica charantia extract on the other hand, exerted significant inhibitory effect on glucose uptake into BBMV. Our in vivo results showed that our herbal formula exhibited a trend to reduce diet-induced increase in body weight and fat pad mass (epididymal, perirenal and inguinal fat); and significantly reduced diet-induced increase in liver weight, liver lipid, and plasma lipid dose-dependently. Besides, high-fat diet induced a significant reduction in adiponectin level which was significantly improved by herbal formula supplementation at 4%. There was however no significant effect of the herbal formula on diet-induced increase in plasma glucose or insulin levels at either dose. Herbal formula also significantly reduced diet-induced inflammation in the liver at both doses. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data suggested the potential of our novel multi-targeted herbal formula to be used as a therapeutic agent for diet-induced metabolic syndrome, with special emphasis on NAFLD.",

        "glucose - GLP-I secretion in healthy and diabetic Wistar rats in response to aqueous extract of Momordica charantia.",
        2018,
        "BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is one of the major global health disorders increasing at an alarming rate in both developed and developing countries. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of aqueous extract of Momordica charantia (AEMC) on fasting blood glucose (FBG), tissue glycogen, glycosylated haemoglobin, plasma concentrations of insulin and GLP-1 hormone (glucagon-like peptide 1) in healthy and diabetic wistar rats. METHODS: Male Wistar rats (both normal and diabetic) were treated with AEMC by gavaging (300 mg/kg body wt/day for 28 days). RESULTS: AEMC was found to increase tissue glycogen, serum insulin and GLP-1 non-significantly (P > 0.05) in normal, significantly (P < 0.01) in diabetic Wistar rats, whereas decrease in FBG and Glycosylated haemoglobin non-significantly (P > 0.05) in normal, significantly (P < 0.01) in diabetic Wistar rats. The elevation of GLP-1 level in normal and diabetic treated groups may be due to the L-cell regeneration and proliferation by binding with L-cell receptors and makes a conformational change, resulting in the activation of a series of signal transducers. The polar molecules of M. charantia also depolarize the L-cell through elevation of intracellular Ca(2+) concentration and which in turn releases GLP-1. GLP-1 in turn elevates beta-cell proliferation and insulin secretion. CONCLUSION: The findings tend to provide a possible explanation for the hypoglycemic action of M. charantia fruit extracts as alternative nutritional therapy in the management and treatment of diabetes.",

        "RNA - MFN2-associated lipomatosis: Clinical spectrum and impact on adipose tissue.",
        2018,
        "BACKGROUND: Multiple symmetric lipomatosis (MSL) is characterized by upper-body lipomatous masses frequently associated with metabolic and neurological signs. MFN2 pathogenic variants were recently implicated in a very rare autosomal recessive form of MSL. MFN2 encodes mitofusin-2, a mitochondrial fusion protein previously involved in Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical, metabolic, tissular, and molecular characteristics of MFN2-associated MSL. METHODS: We sequenced MFN2 in 66 patients referred for altered fat distribution with one or several lipomas or lipoma-like regions and performed clinical and metabolic investigations in patients with positive genetic testing. Lipomatous tissues were studied in 3 patients. RESULTS: Six patients from 5 families carried a homozygous p.Arg707Trp pathogenic variant, representing the largest reported series of MFN2-associated MSL. Patients presented both lipomatous masses and a lipodystrophic syndrome (lipoatrophy, low leptinemia and adiponectinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, insulin resistance and/or diabetes). Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy was of highly variable clinical severity. Lipomatous tissue mainly contained hyperplastic unilocular adipocytes, with few multilocular cells. It displayed numerous mitochondrial alterations (increased number and size, structural defects). As compared to control subcutaneous fat, mRNA and protein expression of leptin and adiponectin was strikingly decreased, whereas the CITED1 and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) thermogenic markers were strongly overexpressed. Consistently, serum FGF21 was markedly increased, and (18)F-FDG-PET-scan revealed increased fat metabolic activity. CONCLUSION: MFN2-related MSL is a novel mitochondrial lipodystrophic syndrome involving both lipomatous masses and lipoatrophy. Its complex neurological and metabolic phenotype justifies careful clinical evaluation and multidisciplinary care. Low leptinemia and adiponectinemia, high serum FGF21, and increased (18)F-FDG body fat uptake may be disease markers.",

        "Polysaccharides obtained from Momordica charantia have been shown to exert a hypoglycemic effect, thereby improving glucose metabolism. However, little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying this process. In recent years, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has rapidly emerged as a major transcriptome profiling system. Herein, RNA-seq was utilized to obtain whole transcriptomes from the livers of SD rats with type 2 diabetes (DM) and type 2 diabetic rats treated with M. charantia polysaccharides (DMCPIIa). In total, 44,752,508-52,585,920 uniquely mapped reads were obtained, covering 85.54% of the annotated transcripts and representing 12,857 mRNA transcripts. Following analytical analysis, 17 differentially expressed genes (p<0.05, false discovery rate q<0.05) were identified in the DMCPIIa group relative to the DM group. Gene ontology and pathway analysis demonstrated that 17 differently expressed genes were enriched in specific biological processes mainly relating to glucose metabolism and fat metabolism (p<0.05). Furthermore, a subset of the differential genes was selected for validation via real-time quantitative reverse-transcription PCR. Collectively, the integrated analysis of differential gene expression, data obtained herein and the examination of previously reported quantitative trait loci, and genome-wide association studies has suggested that pdk4, pkl, hsd11beta1, msmo1, rbp4 and fads2 may serve as promising candidates for the modulation of type 2 diabetes.",

        2019,
        "Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are characterized by deficient insulin secretion and decreased beta-cell mass. Thus, regenerative strategies to increase beta-cell mass need to be developed. To characterize mechanisms of beta-cell plasticity, we studied a model of severe insulin resistance in the adult mouse and defined how beta-cells adapt. Chronic corticosterone (CORT) treatment was given to adult mice and led to rapid insulin resistance and adaptive increased insulin secretion. Adaptive and massive increase of beta-cell mass was observed during treatment up to 8 weeks. beta-Cell mass increase was partially reversible upon treatment cessation and reinduced upon subsequent treatment. beta-Cell neogenesis was suggested by an increased number of islets, mainly close to ducts, and increased Sox9 and Ngn3 mRNA levels in islets, but lineage-tracing experiments revealed that neoformed beta-cells did not derive from Sox9- or Ngn3-expressing cells. CORT treatment after beta-cell depletion partially restored beta-cells. Finally, beta-cell neogenesis was shown to be indirectly stimulated by CORT because serum from CORT-treated mice increased beta-cell differentiation in in vitro cultures of pancreatic buds. Altogether, the results present a novel model of beta-cell neogenesis in the adult mouse and identify the presence of neogenic factors in the serum of CORT-treated mice.",

The extract of Ligularia fischeri leaves (LFE) is traditionally used as a folk medicine for treating inflammatory diseases in Korea as well. In this study, we investigated the synergistic effect of MCE combined with LFE on antihyperglycemic and antihyperlipidemic potentials. Based on the alpha-glucosidase inhibitory effect and promotion of adipocyte differentiation in the 3T3-L1 cell line, the MLM was prepared with MCE:LFE (8:2 weight:weight). MLM showed the synergistic effects in the promotion of the glucose uptake rate, suppression of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) mRNA expression, upregulation of an insulin receptor substrate and glucose transporter type-4 expression, and an increase in insulin-associated signaling in C2C12 cells. In addition, the efficacy of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma agonism and glucose uptake rate by MLM supplementation was significantly enhanced in vitro. Then, the antihyperglycemic and antihyperlipidemic effects of MCE, LFE, and MLM at the dose of 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg/day (n = 6 per each group) were determined in streptozotocin (STZ)-insulted mice fed an atherogenic diet (ATH) for 4 weeks. In addition, MLM (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg/day, n = 5 per each group) was supplemented in ATH-fed db/db mice for 10 weeks. Compared with MCE or LFE alone, MLM supplementation led to a more significant reduction of glucose levels in both STZ/ATH and db/db/ATH mice as well as lowered lipid profiles in STZ/ATH mice. In addition, the stimulation of islet of Langerhans regeneration was more pronounced by MLM supplementation in both mice models. In conclusion, antihyperglycemic and antihyperlipidemic effects were strengthened by the combined extracts of L. fischeri and M. charantia (MLM) in diabetes-mimicking mice.",

        2018,
        "Diabetes-associated cardiac fibrosis is a severe cardiovascular complication. Momordicine I, a bioactive triterpenoid isolated from bitter melon, has been demonstrated to have antidiabetic properties. This study investigated the effects of momordicine I on high-glucose-induced cardiac fibroblast activation. Rat cardiac fibroblasts were cultured in a high-glucose (25 mM) medium in the absence or presence of momordicine I, and the changes in collagen synthesis, transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) production, and related signaling molecules were assessed. Increased oxidative stress plays a critical role in the development of high-glucose-induced cardiac fibrosis; we further explored momordicine I's antioxidant activity and its effect on fibroblasts. Our data revealed that a high-glucose condition promoted fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis and these effects were abolished by momordicine I (0.3 and 1 muM) pretreatment. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of momordicine I on high-glucose-induced fibroblast activation may be associated with its activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and the inhibition of reactive oxygen species formation, TGF-beta1 production, and Smad2/3 phosphorylation. The addition of brusatol (a selective inhibitor of Nrf2) or Nrf2 siRNA significantly abolished the inhibitory effect of momordicine I on fibroblast activation. Our findings revealed that the antifibrotic effect of momordicine I was mediated, at least partially, by the inhibition of the TGF-beta1/Smad pathway, fibroblast proliferation, and collagen synthesis through Nrf2 activation. Thus, this work provides crucial insights into the molecular pathways for the clinical application of momordicine I for treating diabetes-associated cardiac fibrosis.",

However, human studies that investigated its glycemic control have generated inconsistent findings. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis is aimed at evaluating the safety and efficacy of M. charantia L. preparations in human studies that have investigated its role in glycemic control. METHODS: This protocol has been prepared according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P). The review will include randomized clinical trials and non-randomized clinical trials. The included studies will have assessed glycemic control of M. charantia preparations with placebo or standard oral anti-hyperglycemic agents in adult pre-diabetes and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and have at least 4 weeks of follow-up. The primary outcomes of review are fasting blood glucose levels, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c, and post-prandial blood glucose level. Electronic database search for published literatures will be conducted without language restriction in EMBASE, MEDLINE/PubMed, the Cochrane Library, SCOPUS, Web of Sciences, and CINAHL databases. Search for gray literatures and references of the retrieved full-text articles will be conducted in Google, Google Scholar, OpenGrey, ProQuest dissertations & Theses, British Library EThos, and university digital library systems. Two independent reviewers will later evaluate full texts, extract data, and assess risk of bias of eligible articles. Publication biases will be assessed by testing asymmetry of funnel plot using Egger's or Begg's tests while heterogeneity will be assessed using Cochran Q test, P value, and I(2). Revman software version 5.3 will be used for meta-analysis including subgroup and sensitivity analysis. DISCUSSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis will investigate both safety and efficacy of M. charantia preparations in type 2 diabetes mellitus. The review results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. The results will bring better understanding of clinical outcomes in treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and highlight gaps for future research.

        2019,
        "Despite the availability of a large number of therapeutic options throughout the world, rates of optimal glycaemic control in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus remain low. Delays in treatment intensification to insulin and low adherence to insulin regimes, which are well-documented contributors to poor glycaemic control, are in many cases driven by fear of hypoglycaemic events, weight gain and injections. Over the last 10 years, injectable glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RAs) have emerged as alternatives to basal insulin for treatment intensification in patients inadequately controlled with oral antidiabetic drugs. As a class, GLP1-RAs are associated with weight loss and fewer hypoglycaemic events than insulin. In addition, some of them are available in once-a-week formulations and therefore require fewer injections. However, as randomized controlled trials are not representative of everyday practice, physicians should consider the results of real-life studies to guide their treatment decisions. In this review, while significant variations in efficacy, tolerability and adherence data were noted from one study to another, rates of glycaemic control overall were low. Indeed, our present analysis has suggested that regular re-evaluations of treatment, including response, tolerability, adherence, cost and quality of life, are necessary.",

As current treatments are not sufficiently able to control the disease, studies focusing on the identification and discovery of new therapeutic agents are necessary. Natural products have been used for a long time for the management of different neurological problems including neuropathies. The aim of the present study is to review the current clinical data on the beneficial effects of medicinal plants in neuropathy.

Medicinal plants were evaluated clinically in several types of neuropathy, including diabetic neuropathy, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, carpal tunnel syndrome, and HIV-associated neuropathy. Some studies reported the improvement in pain, nerve function, nerve conduction velocity, and quality of life. Cannabis sativa (hemp), Linum usitatissimum (linseed oil), capsaicin, and a polyherbal Japanese formulation called Goshajinkigan had the most evidence regarding their clinical efficacy. Other investigated herbal medicines in neuropathy, such as Matricaria chamomilla (chamomile), Curcuma longa (turmeric), and Citrullus colocynthis (colocynth), had only one clinical trial.

        2019,
        "Systemic and tissue-specific inflammation has a profound influence on regulation of metabolism, and therefore, strategies to reduce inflammation are of special interest in prevention and treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Antiobesity and antidiabetic properties of Momordica charantia (bitter melon, BM) have been linked to its protective effects on inflammation and gut microbial dysbiosis. We investigated the mechanisms by which freeze-driedBM juice reduces adipose inflammation in mice fed a 60% high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks. Although earlier studies indicated that BM inhibited recruitment of macrophages (Mphi) infiltration in adipose tissue of rodents and reduced NF-kB and IL-1beta secretions, the mechanisms remain unknown. We demonstrate that freeze-driedBM juice inhibits recruitment of Mphi into adipose tissue and its polarization to inflammatory phenotype possibly due to reduction of sphingokinase 1 (SPK1) mRNA in HFD-fed mice. Furthermore, reduction of IL-1beta secretion by freeze-driedBM juice in the adipose tissue of HFD-fed mice is correlated to alleviation of NLRP3 inflammasome components and their downstream signaling targets. We confirm previous observations that BM inhibited inflammation of colon and gut microbial dysbiosis in HFD-fed mice, which in part may be associated with the observed anti-inflammatory effects in adipose tissue if HFD-fed mice. Overall, functional foods such as BM may offer potential dietary interventions that may impact sterile inflammatory diseases such as obesity and T2D.",

Compared to RIPs from hairy gourd, bitter gourd, ridge gourd, garden pea, and the mushroom Flammulina velutipes, marmorin was more potent in its antiproliferative activity toward hepatoma (HepG2) and breast cancer (MCF-7) cells, similar in inhibitory potency toward HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (with the exception that it was more potent than ridge gourd RIP and bitter gourd RIP), and less potent in translation-inhibitory potency. Marmorin was devoid of antifungal, protease, RNase, mitogenic, anti-mitogenic, nitric oxide-inducing, hemagglutinating, and trypsin inhibitory activities.",

        "This review describes the nature and applications of ribosome inactivating proteins (RIPs) from Momordica charantia (bitter melon). RIPs from the plant kingdom have received much attention in biomedical research because they target conserved host protein synthesis machinery and show specificity towards human and animal cell targets. Recent studies aimed at unravelling the enzymatic activities of the M charantia RIPs provide a structural basis for their activities. It has been reported that RIPs are member of the single chain ribosome inactivating protein (SCRIP) family which act irreversibly on ribosome by removing adenine residue from eukaryotic ribosomal RNA. Various activities of RIPs include anti-tumor, broad anti-viral, ribonuclease and deoxyribonuclease. MAP30 (Momordica Anti-HIV Protein), alpha- and beta-momorcharins inhibit HIV replication in acutely and chronically infected cells and thus are considered potential therapeutic agent in HIV infection and AIDS. Further, MAP30 improved the efficacy of anti-HIV therapy when used in combination with other anti-viral drugs. MAP30 holds therapeutic promise over other RIPs because not only it is active against infection and replication of both HSV and HIV but is non toxic to normal cells. Here we review the nature, action, structure function relationship and applications of RIPs from Momordica charantia and evaluate their potential for anti-cancer and anti-viral therapy.",

        "Cancer metastasis is a major cause of death in cancer patients, with invasion as a first step greatly contributing to the failure of clinical treatments. Any compounds with an inhibitory influence on this process are therefore of prime interest. Momordica charantia (bitter melon) is widely consumed as a vegetable and especially as a folk medicine in Asia. Here, we investigated the anti-invasive effects of bitter melon leaf extract (BMLE) on a rat prostate cancer cell line (PLS10) in vitro and in vivo. The results indicated that non-toxic concentrations of BMLE significantly inhibited the migration and invasion of cells in vitro. The results of zymography showed that BMLE inhibited the secretion of MMP-2, MMP-9 and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) from PLS10. Real-time RT-PCR revealed that BMLE not only significantly decreased gene expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9, but also markedly increased the mRNA level of TIMP-2, known to have inhibitory effects on the activity of MMP-2. An EnzChek gelatinase/collagenase assay showed that collagenase type IV activity was partially inhibited by BMLE. In the in vivo study, intravenous inoculation of PLS10 to nude mice resulted in a 100% survival rate in the mice given a BMLE-diet as compared with 80% in the controls. The incidence of lung metastasis did not show any difference, but the percentage lung area occupied by metastatic lesions was slightly decreased in the 0.1% BMLE treatment group and significantly decreased with 1% BMLE treatment as compared with the control. Thus, the results indicate for the first time an anti-metastatic effect of BMLE both in vitro and in vivo.",

        "In this study, we focused on the effects of a bitter melon (Momordica charantia) leaf extract (BMLE) and a purified component, Kuguacin J (KuJ), on androgen-dependent LNCaP human prostate cancer cells. Both treatments exerted growth inhibition through G1 arrest and induction of apoptosis. In addition, KuJ markedly decreased the levels of cyclins (D1 and E), cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk2 and Cdk4) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and caused an increase in p21 and p27 levels. Its induction of apoptosis was accompanied by an increase in cleavage of caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, attributable to augment of Bax/Bcl-2 and Bad/Bcl-xL and reduction of survivin levels. BMLE and KuJ also reduced the expression of androgen receptor (AR), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) while induced P53 protein level. Down-regulation of p53 by RNA interference indicated that BMLE and KuJ inhibited cell growth partly through p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and apoptotic pathways. Both BMLE and KuJ caused less toxicity in a normal prostate cell line, PNT1A. Our results suggest that BMLE and a purified component, KuJ, from its diethyl ether fraction could be promising candidate new antineoplastic and chemopreventive agents for androgen-dependent prostate cancer and carcinogenesis.",

In view of the poor prognosis of unresectable liver cancers, it is of pivotal importance to develop novel chemotherapeutical regimens. RNase MC2 is a 14-kDa ribonuclease isolated from dietary bitter gourd (Momordica charantia) that manifested antitumor potential against breast cancers. In this study, we investigated the potential application of RNase MC2 on Hep G2 cells. We showed that RNase MC2 inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis in both in vitro and in vivo studies. RNase MC2 treatment caused cell cycle arrest predominantly at the S-phase and apoptosis, which is associated with the activation of both caspase-8 and caspase-9 regulated caspase pathways. Our further investigation disclosed that RNase MC2 down-regulated the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and increased the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bak. Moreover, the phosphorylation of ERK and JNK was involved in the apoptosis process. Importantly, RNase MC2 significantly suppressed the growth of Hep G2 xenograft-bearing nude mice by inducing apoptosis. This notion is supported by data indicating an increased number of caspase-3- and PARP-positive cells, and TUNEL-positive cells in RNase MC2-treated tumor tissues. In summary, we have revealed the antitumor potential of RNase MC2 toward Hep G2 cells. Considering that bitter gourd is a common dietary component in many countries, this study may help to prompt the clinical application of RNase MC2.",

        "Cucurbitacin I (CBI) is a triterpene from a bitter melon called Goya grown in Okinawa, Japan, and directly inhibits both the Tyr-kinase JAK2 and the G protein RAC, leading to the inactivation of PAK1 (RAC/CDC42-activated kinase 1). Bio 30, a propolis produced in New Zealand, contains CAPE (caffeic acid phenethyl ester) as the major anti-cancer ingredient which directly down-regulates RAC, leading to the inactivation of PAK1. Since PAK1 is essential for the growth of RAS cancer cells such as A549 cell line which carry an oncogenic K-RAS mutant, and the melanogenesis in skin cells, here using these PAK1-blockers as model compounds, we introduce a new approach to the quick assessment of PAK1-blockers in cell culture. First, combining the immuno-precipitation (IP) of PAK1 from cell lysate and the in vitro ATP_Glo kinase assay kit (called \"Macaroni-Western\" assay), we confirmed that both CBI and Bio 30 inactivate PAK1 in A549 lung cancer cells in 24 h, and inhibit their PAK1-dependent growth in 72 h. Furthermore, we verified that CBI inhibits the PAK1/PAK4-dependent melanogenesis in melanoma cells by far more than 50%, while Bio 30 inhibits the melanogenesis only by 50%, with only a merginal effect on their growth per se. Since the \"Macaroni-Western\" kinase assay and melanogenesis are both rather simple and quick, the combination of these two cell culture assays would be highly useful for selecting both \"potent\" (highly cell-permeable) and \"safe\" (non-toxic) natural or synthetic PAK1-blockers.",

        "The production of short anticancer peptides in recombinant form is an alternative method for costly chemical manufacturing. However, the limitations of host toxicity, bioactivity and column purification have impaired production in mass quantities. In this study, short cationic peptides were produced in aggregated inclusion bodies by double fusion with a central protein that has anti-cancer activity. The anticancer peptides Tachiplicin I (TACH) and Latarcin 1 (LATA) were fused with the N- and C-terminus of the MAP30 protein, respectively. We successfully produced the recombinant TACH-MAP30-LATA protein and MAP30 alone in E. coli that represented 59% and 68% of the inclusion bodies. The purified form of the inclusion bodies was prepared by eliminating host cell proteins through multiple washing steps and semi-solubilization in alkaline buffer. The purified active protein was recovered by inclusive solubilization at pH 12.5 in the presence of 2 M urea and refolded in alkaline buffer containing oxides and reduced glutathione. The peptide-fusion protein showed lower CC50 values against cancer cells (HepG2, 0.35+/-0.1 muM and MCF-7, 0.58+/-0.1 muM) compared with normal cells (WRL68, 1.83+/-0.2 muM and ARPE19, 2.5+/-0.1 muM) with outstanding activity compared with its individual components. The presence of the short peptides facilitated the entry of the peptide fusion protein into cancer cells (1.8 to 2.2-fold) compared with MAP30 alone through direct interaction with the cell membrane. The cancer chemotherapy agent doxorubicin showed higher efficiency and selectivity against cancer cells in combination with the peptide- fusion protein. This study provides new data on the mass production of short anticancer peptides as inclusion bodies in E. coli by fusion with a central protein that has similar activity.

Nevertheless, drug resistance is the major obstacle for clinical management of these diseases especially ovarian cancer. In the past years, substantial studies have been carried out with the aim of exploring alternative therapeutic approaches to enhance efficacy of current chemotherapeutic regimes and reduce the side effects caused in order to produce significant advantages in overall survival and to improve patients' quality of life. Targeting cancer cell metabolism by the application of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-activating agents is believed to be one of the most plausible attempts. AMPK activators such as 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-beta-d-ribofuranoside, A23187, metformin, and bitter melon extract not only prevent cancer progression and metastasis but can also be applied as a supplement to enhance the efficacy of cisplatin-based chemotherapy in human cancers such as ovarian cancer.

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of many nutraceuticals in anticancer still remain obscure.

We cloned a novel protein from Trichosanthes kirilowii Maximowicz (Family Cucurbitaceae) named TYchi. Expression of TYchi gene in T. kirilowii plants was induced by F. oxysporum, an important cucurbitaceous fungal pathogen, which indicated that TYchi involved in the pathogen-induced plant defense reaction. In addition to its chitin-hydrolytic activity, the recombinant TYchi protein also had RNA N-glycosidase property. In cell-free rabbit reticulocyte lysate system, TYchi inhibited protein synthesis with an IC50 of approximate 5 nM. TYchi also exhibited efficient cytotoxicities to leukemia U937 and choriocarcinoma JAR cells with IC50 about 54 microg ml(-1) and 73 microg ml(-1), respectively. Structure analyses indicated that the putative domain of TYchi is highly similar to the well known active domain of the N-glycosidase trichosanthin (TCS). This bifuntional protein should be useful in diverse applications like RIP-based immunotoxin agent and genetic engineering of plant resistance.",

In the normal glucose primed rat model, M. charantia fruit extract, 500 mg kg-1, depressed the plasma glucose levels by 10-15% at 1 h. Under similar conditions, tolbutamide (100 mg kg-1) caused approximately 40% reductions in plasma glucose both at 1 and 2 h. At 500 mg kg-1, the efficacy of M. charantia was 25-30% of tolbutamide. The reduction in plasma glucose in normal glucose primed rat was not accompanied by increased insulin secretion. There was no evidence of tachyphylaxis to the effect of M. charantia extract on repeated dosing. In streptozotocin diabetes rats, it improved the oral glucose tolerance causing significant (P < 0.002) reduction in plasma glucose of 26% at 3.5 h while metformin caused 40-50% reduction at 1, 2 and 3.5 h. M. charantia extract (500 mg kg-1) caused a 4-5-fold increase in the rate of glycogen synthesis from U-14C-glucose in the liver of normally fed rats. These data suggest that the mechanism of action of M. charantia could be partly attributed to increased glucose utilization in the liver rather than an insulin secretion effect.

A few vegetables that are commonly consumed in India have been claimed to possess antidiabetic potency. In recent years, there has been a renewed interest to screen such plant food materials, for a possible beneficial use. Considerable amount of work has been carried out in this regard with bitter gourd (Momordica charantia) and ivy gourd (Coccinia indica) both in experimental animals and human diabetic subjects. Majority of these studies have documented the beneficial effect of the fruit of bitter gourd and leaf of ivy gourd when administered orally as a single dose. The hypoglycaemic influence is claimed to be mediated through an insulin secretagogue effect or through an influence on enzymes involved in glucose metabolism. The limited number of studies on other vegetables such as cabbage (Brassica oleracia), green leafy vegetables, beans and tubers have shown the beneficial hypoglycaemic influence in both experimental animals and humans. There is scope for more extensive research in this area, especially to examine the long term beneficial effect of dietary vegetables, to identify the active principle, and to understand the mechanism of action, which is at present unclear.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Previously diagnosed type 2 diabetes is defined by the current use of oral hypoglycaemic treatment and newly diagnosed subjects by fasting plasma glucose (FPG) > or =7.0 mmol/L according to the ADA 1997 recommendations. IFG was determined by 6.1< or =FPG< or =6.9 mmol/L. Adjusted prevalences are calculated according to the French 1990 census data. RESULTS: Type 2 diabetes adjusted prevalence is 5.1% [4.1-6.1] in women and 7.3% [6.1-8.4] in men while IFG adjusted prevalence is 5.2% [4.2-6.2] and 11.8% [10.3-13.4] respectively. Prevalences of type 2 diabetes and IFG are both significantly higher in men than in women. This trend appears in any age group for IFG, but is only observed in 55-64 year-old subjects for type 2 diabetes. The reduction of the FPG threshold to screen diabetes mellitus from 7.8 to 7.0 mmol/L according to the ADA recommendations results in a 2.2-fold increase in the number of newly diagnosed diabetic subjects, screened by one FPG measurement, in our population-based sample. CONCLUSIONS: The MONICA population survey confirms that type 2 diabetes represents a major health care problem in France and underlines the influence of gender on the prevalence of both type 2 diabetes and IFG in the French middle-aged population.",

Our aim was to prospectively evaluate the efficacy on patient skills and metabolic control of our routine 5-day in-patient education programme. METHODS: Over one year, each type 1 diabetic patient undertaking the programme for the first time, and able to complete a 2, 6, and 12 month follow-up, participated in the study (n=76). At baseline (T0), 61 patients had intensified insulin treatment and 15 increased from 2 to 3 daily insulin injections during the hospital stay. Using questionnaires and analysis of a glycaemia logbook, we evaluated at T0, T2, T6 and T12 patient skills related to diet, physical exercise, self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), adjustment of insulin doses, and treatment of hypoglycaemia. Metabolic control was evaluated at the same time. RESULTS: At one year, the following skills improved: Intake of carbohydrates (T0: 59%, T12: 90% of patients, p<0.001) and snacks (p<0.001), appropriate physical exercise (p<0.001), frequency of SMBG (T0: 3.3 +/- 1.5/day, T12: 4.5 +/- 1/day, p<0.001), frequency of post-prandial tests (p<0.001) and adjustment of insulin doses (T0: 18%, T12: 53% of patients, p<0.001). More patients always carried sugar (T0: 61%, T12: 97%, p<0.001) and appropriately treated hypoglycaemia (T0: 48%, T12: 79%, p<0.001). Concurrently, HbA(1c) decreased (T0: 8.6 +/- 1.5%, T12: 7.7 +/- 0.9%, p<0.001), and the frequency of hypoglycaemia was reduced (p<0.001). There was a correlation between the decrease of HbA(1c) and the frequency of SMBG (p<0.001, r2=0,24).

        "OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of the published literature on the efficacy and safety of herbal therapies and vitamin/mineral supplements for glucose control in patients with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted an electronic literature search of MEDLINE, OLDMEDLINE, Cochrane Library Database, and HealthSTAR, from database inception to May 2002, in addition to performing hand searches and consulting with experts in the field. Available clinical studies published in the English language that used human participants and examined glycemic control were included. Data were extracted in a standardized manner, and two independent investigators assessed methodological quality of randomized controlled trials using the Jadad scale. RESULTS: A total of 108 trials examining 36 herbs (single or in combination) and 9 vitamin/mineral supplements, involving 4,565 patients with diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance, met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. There were 58 controlled clinical trials involving individuals with diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance (42 randomized and 16 nonrandomized trials). Most studies involved patients with type 2 diabetes. Heterogeneity and the small number of studies per supplement precluded formal meta-analyses. Of these 58 trials, the direction of the evidence for improved glucose control was positive in 76% (44 of 58). Very few adverse effects were reported. CONCLUSIONS: There is still insufficient evidence to draw definitive conclusions about the efficacy of individual herbs and supplements for diabetes; however, they appear to be generally safe. The available data suggest that several supplements may warrant further study. The best evidence for efficacy from adequately designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is available for Coccinia indica and American ginseng.

        "Over the centuries, Chinese herbal drugs have served as a major source of medicines for the prevention and treatment of diseases including diabetes mellitus (known as 'Xiao-ke'). It is estimated that more than 200 species of plants exhibit hypoglycaemic properties, including many common plants, such as pumpkin, wheat, celery, wax guard, lotus root and bitter melon. To date, hundreds of herbs and traditional Chinese medicine formulas have been reported to have been used for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. This paper provides a brief review of the antidiabetic drugs of plant origin that have been approved by the Chinese health regulatory agency for commercial use in China. It was believed, through pharmacological studies, that medicinal herbs were meticulously organized in these antidiabetic drug formulas such that polysaccharide containing herbs restore the functions of pancreatic tissues and cause an increase in insulin output by the functional beta cells, while other ingredients enhance the microcirculation, increase the availability of insulin and facilitate the metabolism in insulin-dependent processes. Pharmacological and clinical evaluations indicated that these drugs had a mild, but significant, blood glucose lowering effect and that the long-term use of these agents may be advantageous over chemical drugs in alleviating some of the chronic diseases and complications caused by diabetes. Additionally, the use of these natural agents in conjunction with conventional drug treatments, such as a chemical agent or insulin, permits the use of lower doses of the drug and/or decreased frequency of administration which decreases the side effects most commonly observed.",

Rodent studies suggest that the thus-far-uncharacterized active components of such extracts enhance the efficiency of postprandial glucose storage in muscle and liver, and likely diminish excessive hepatic glucose output, while often down-regulating serum insulin--effects comparable to those reported for metformin. Other parallels between the actions of metformin and bitter melon in rodents appear to include: analogous effects on the hepatic activity of certain enzymes of glucose metabolism; increased expression of GLUT4 in the plasma membrane of skeletal muscle; a tendency to prevent weight gain; favorable effects on serum lipids; and an anti-promotional impact on cancer induction. Inasmuch as the clinical efficacy of metformin has recently been traced to its ability to activate AMP-activated kinase, it would be of interest to determine whether bitter melon extracts contain activators of this enzyme. The fact that bitter melon has the potential to down-regulate insulin suggests that, beyond its likely utility in the management of diabetes, it may have preventive value with respect to a wide range of disorders in which hyperinsulinemia plays a pathogenic role--and possibly could even favorably impact the aging process.",

        "This study investigated the beneficial effects and mechanism of action of the juice of Momordica charantia in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes mellitus in rats. Diabetes mellitus was associated with significant (p < 0.01) time course reductions in body weight, plasma insulin and the number of insulin positive cells per islet and significant (p < 0.01) time course elevation in blood glucose and osmolarity and systolic blood pressure compared to age-matched healthy controls. Oral intake of M. charantia juice by STZ-induced diabetic rats partially reversed all the diabetes-induced effects measured. Daily oral administration of M. charantia juice to STZ-induced diabetic rates significantly (p < 0.01) reduced the Na+- and K+-dependent absorptions of glucose by the brush border membrane vesicles of the jejunum compared to the responses obtained in STZ-induced diabetic rat. Either insulin (100 MM) or the fruit juice lyophilised extract (5 microg x ml(-1)) can stimulate 14C-D-glucose uptake in L6 myotubes. These effects were completely blocked by wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. High concentrations (10-200 microg x ml(-1)) of M. charantia juice extract inhibited 14C-D-glucose uptake in L6 myotubes compared to the control response. The effect of M. charantia treatment was also investigated on myelinated fibre abnormalities in the tibial nerve of STZ-induced diabetic and control rats. The results show that diabetes was associated with significant (p < 0.05) reduction in the mean cross-sectional myelinated nerve fibres, axonal area, myelin area and maximal fibre area compared to end controls. Treatment of STZ-induced diabetic rats with M. charantia juice normalised the structural abnormalities of peripheral nerves. The results indicate that M. charantia can exert marked beneficial effects in diabetic rats, and moreover, it can regulate glucose uptake into jejunum membrane brush border vesicles and stimulate glucose uptake into skeletal muscle cells similar to the response obtained with insulin.",

Dianex was administered in different doses of 100-500 mg/kg/day orally in acute (6 h) and long-term (6 weeks) studies. Blood glucose levels were checked 2-6 h after treatment in acute studies and every 2 weeks in long-term studies. Body weight was recorded on the first and final day of the treatment in the long-term studies with diabetic mice. After 6 weeks, high-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, total cholesterol, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspertate transaminase (AST), urea and creatinine were estimated in serum of the diabetic mice. Glycogen and total protein levels were estimated in the liver. Also, the liver and pancreas was subjected to histological examination. Oral glucose tolerance and in vitro free radical scavenging activity was also studied. Dianex produced significant (p<0.05) hypoglycemic activity at 250-500 mg/kg doses in both normal and diabetic mice in acute and long-term studies. The body weight of diabetic mice significantly (p<0.05) increased with all tested doses of Dianex. The elevated triglycerides, cholesterol, ALT, AST, urea and creatinine levels in diabetic mice were significantly (p<0.05) reduced at the doses of 250 and 500 mg/kg. The liver glycogen and protein levels were both significantly (p<0.05) increased in diabetic mice at 250 and 500 mg/kg doses. Dianex increased the glucose tolerance significantly (p<0.05) in both normal and diabetic mice at all the doses tested. Histopathological examination showed that the formulation decreased streptozotocin induced injury to the tissues at all the doses tested. It produced significant (p<0.05) free radical scavenging activity against ABTS+, DPPH and hydroxyl free radicals at the concentrations ranging between 10-1000 microg/ml.Thus, in the present study, Dianex produced significant hypoglycemic activity in both normal and diabetic animals. It also reversed other diabetic complications in diabetic mice at 250 and 500 mg/kg doses. In our earlier study, Dianex was well tolerated in laboratory animals at higher doses (upto 10 g/kg in mice, acute toxicity; up to 2.5 g/kg in rats, subacute toxicity studies for 30 days) without exhibiting any toxic manifestation. Hence, Dianex may be useful in the treatment of diabetes mellitus.",

        "Bitter gourd (Momordica charantia), a commonly consumed vegetable is used as an adjunct in the management of diabetes mellitus. A study was carried out to examine the effect of edible portion of bitter gourd at 10% level in the diet in streptozotocin induced diabetic rats. To evaluate the glycaemic control of bitter gourd during diabetes, diet intake, gain in body weight, water intake, urine sugar, urine volume, glomerular filtration rate and fasting blood glucose profiles were monitored. Water consumption, urine volume and urine sugar were significantly higher in diabetic controls compared to normal rats and bitter gourd feeding alleviated this rise during diabetes by about 30%. Renal hypertrophy was higher in diabetic controls and bitter gourd supplementation, partially, but effectively prevented it (38%) during diabetes. Increased glomerular filtration rate in diabetes was significantly reduced (27%) by bitter gourd. An amelioration of about 30% in fasting blood glucose was observed with bitter gourd feeding in diabetic rats. These results clearly provided experimental evidence that dried bitter gourd powder in the diet at 10% level improved diabetic status signifying its beneficial effect during diabetes.",

        2006,
        "Bitter gourd (Momordica charantia L.) is a common vegetable in Asia that has been used in traditional medicine for the treatment of Diabetes. PPARs are ligand-dependent transcription factors that belong to the steroid hormone nuclear receptor family and control lipid and glucose homeostasis in the body. We previously reported that the ethyl acetate (EA) extract of bitter gourd activated peroxisome proliferator receptors (PPARs) alpha and gamma. To identify the active compound that activated PPARalpha, wild bitter gourd EA extract was partitioned between n-hexane and 90% methanol/10% H(2)O, and the n-hexane soluble fraction was further separated by silica gel column chromatography and finally by preparative HPLC. A transactivation assay employing a clone of CHOK1 cells stably transfected with a (UAS)(4)-tk-alkaline phosphatase reporter and a chimeric receptor of GAL4-rPPARalpha LBD was used to track the active component. Based on Mass, NMR, and IR spectroscopy, 9cis, 11trans, 13trans-conjugated linolenic acid (9c, 11t, 13t-CLN) was identified as a PPARalpha activator in wild bitter gourd. The isolated 9c, 11t, 13t-CLN rich fraction also significantly induced acyl CoA oxidase (ACO) activity in a peroxisome proliferator-responsive murine hepatoma cell line, H4IIEC3, implying that 9c, 11t, 13t-CLN was able to act on a natural PPARalpha signaling pathway as well. The content of 9c, 11t, 13t-CLN was estimated to be about 7.1 g/kg of our dried wild bitter gourd sample. The concentration of 9c, 11t, 13t-CLN and activation activity in the hydrolyzed EA extract of the seeds was higher than that of the flesh. The potential health benefits of 9c, 11t, 13t-CLN through the PPARalpha regulated mechanism are worthy to be further characterized in in vivo studies.",

        "The current pharmacological therapy of type 2 diabetes reduces the risk of diabetic complications, but is not able to achieve a long-lasting normalization of the metabolic disorder. Thus diabetic patients in increasing numbers are taking dietary supplements and herbs from which they expect additional health benefits. These unconventional antidiabetic agents consist mainly in trace metals like chromium, vanadium and zinc and a heterogeneous group of traditionally used antidiabetic herbs (e. g. Momordica charantia, Gymnema sylvestre, Trigonella foenum-graecum) often derived from the ayurvedic medicine. In this overview the current evidence for the antidiabetic effect is presented. The trace elements chromium and vanadium have a number of potentially antidiabetic actions in vitro, however, the results obtained with diabetic patients are not convincing so far. Similarly, the available data on the therapeutic use of herbs suggest that in principle a number of them possess a blood glucose-lowering effect, but at present no firm conclusions as to their efficacy and safety can be made. To set up reliable dose-effect relationships requires the identification of the relevant antidiabetic molecules as was apparently achieved by isolating 4-hydroxyisoleucine from the seeds of T. foenum-graecum. This requirement is also valid in the case of the antidiabetic action of cinnamon. Coffee and a moderate alcohol consumption were found to be surprisingly effective in lowering the risk of type 2 diabetes manifestation, their effect being roughly equal to that of conventional drugs used in diabetes prevention trials. Diabetic patients should inform their physician about the use of unconventional agents and should be warned against uncontrolled starting or stopping their use.",

        "Diabetes mellitus is known to affect collagen in various tissues. Umbelliferone (7-hydroxycoumarin), a natural antioxidant and benzopyrone, is found in golden apple (Aegle marmelos Correa) and bitter orange (Citrus aurantium). Plant-derived phenolic coumarins have been shown to act as dietary antioxidants. In this study, we have investigated the influence of umbelliferone on collagen content and its effects on the tail tendon in streptozotocin-diabetic rats. Male albino Wistar rats (180-200 g) were made diabetic by intraperitoneal administration of streptozotocin (40 mg/kg). Normal and diabetic rats were treated with umbelliferone for 45 days. Diabetic rats had increased glucose and decreased insulin levels. Tail tendons of diabetic rats had increased total collagen, glycation and fluorescence, and decreased levels of neutral, acid and pepsin-soluble collagens. We have studied the effect of umbelliferone on haemostatic function because umbelliferone is also a coumarin derivative like the anticoagulant, warfarin. Diabetic rats had a significant decrease in prothrombin, clotting and bleeding time, and treatment with umbelliferone made these parameters almost normal. Our results show that umbelliferone controls glycaemia and has a beneficial effect on collagen content and its properties, i.e. collagen related parameters, in the tail tendon, which indicates recovery from the risk (recovery of animals from the risk of complications) of collagen-mediated diabetic polyneuropathy and diabetic nephropathy.",

In our study, diabetic rats had increased level of blood glucose and lipid peroxidation markers, and decreased level of plasma insulin and decreased activities of total ATPases, (Na(+)+K(+))-ATPase, low affinity Ca(2+)-ATPase and Mg(2+)-ATPase in erythrocytes and tissues. Restoration of plasma insulin and glucose by UMB and glibenclamide seemed to have reversed insulin, glucose and lipid peroxidation markers, and diabetes-induced alterations in the activities of membrane-bound ATPases.

        "BACKGROUND: The MCE, Momordica charantia fruit extract Linn. (Cucurbitaceae) have been documented to elicit hypoglycemic activity on various occasions. However, due to lack of standardization of these extracts, their efficacy remains questionable. The present study was undertaken by selecting a well standardised MCE. This study reports hypoglycemic and antilipidemic activities of MCE employing relevant animal models and in vitro methods. METHODS: Diabetes was induced in Wistar rats by a s.c., subcutaneous injection of alloxan monohydrate (100 mg/kg) in acetate buffer (pH 4.5). MCE and glibenclamide were administered orally to alloxan diabetic rats at doses of 150 mg/kg, 300 mg/kg & 600 mg/kg, and 4 mg/kg respectively for 30 days, blood was withdrawn for glucose determination on 0, 7, 14, 21 and 30th days. On the 31st day, overnight fasted rats were sacrificed and blood was collected for various biochemical estimations including glycosylated haemoglobin, mean blood glucose, serum insulin, cholesterol, triglcerides, protein and glycogen content of liver. The hemidiaphragms and livers were also isolated, carefully excised and placed immediately in ice cooled perfusion solution and processed to study the glucose uptake/transfer processes. Hypolipidemic activity in old obese rats was evaluated by treating two groups with MCE (150 mg/kg & 300 mg/kg) orally for 30 days and determining total cholesterol, triglyceride and HDL-CH, LDL-CH and VLDL-CH levels from serum samples. RESULTS: Subchronic study of MCE in alloxan induced diabetic rats showed significant antihyperglycemic activity by lowering blood glucose and GHb%, percent glycosylated haemoglobin. Pattern of glucose tolerance curve was also altered significantly. MCE treatment enhanced uptake of glucose by hemidiaphragm and inhibited glycogenolysis in liver slices in vitro. A significant reduction in the serum cholesterol and glyceride levels of obese rats following MCE treatment was also observed. CONCLUSION: Our experimental findings with respect to the mechanism of action of MCE in alloxan diabetic rats suggest that it enhances insulin secretion by the islets of Langerhans, reduces glycogenesis in liver tissue, enhances peripheral glucose utilisation and increases serum protein levels. Furthermore, MCE treatment restores the altered histological architecture of the islets of Langerhans. Hence, the biochemical, pharmacological and histopathological profiles of MCE clearly indicate its potential antidiabetic activity and other beneficial effects in amelioration of diabetes associated complications. Further, an evaluation of its antilipidemic activity in old obese rats demonstrated significant lowering of cholesterol and triglyceride levels while elevating HDL-cholesterol levels. Also, the extract lowered serum lipids in alloxan diabetic rats, suggesting its usefulness in controlling metabolic alterations associated with diabetes.",

These compounds and their aglycones exhibited a number of biologic effects beneficial to diabetes and obesity. In both L6 myotubes and 3T3-L1 adipocytes, they stimulated GLUT4 translocation to the cell membrane--an essential step for inducible glucose entry into cells. This was associated with increased activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key pathway mediating glucose uptake and fatty acid oxidation. Furthermore, momordicoside(s) enhanced fatty acid oxidation and glucose disposal during glucose tolerance tests in both insulin-sensitive and insulin-resistant mice. These findings indicate that cucurbitane triterpenoids, the characteristic constituents of M. charantia, may provide leads as a class of therapeutics for diabetes and obesity.",

With the high prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes, abnormalities in carbohydrate metabolism are common in the general population and obtaining glycemic control is important in reducing the complications of diabetes. If shown to be effective, botanical products have a unique position in potentially aiding the general public in regard to obesity and diabetes. They can be obtained \"over-the-counter\" and may have less side effects compared to many synthetic drugs.

They are Bitter Melon (Momordica charantia), Fenugreek (trigonella foenum graecum), Gymnema Sylvestre, Ivy Gourd (Coccinia indica), Nopal or Prickly Pear Cactus (Opuntia streptacantha), Ginseng, Aloe Vera, Russian Tarragon (Artemisia dracunculus), and Garlic (Allium sativum). The discussion is emphasized on the clinical aspect of these botanicals. Due to the lack of sufficient evidence from clinical studies for any of the botanicals reviewed, it is premature to actively recommend use of any particular herb to treat either glucose or other risk factors.

Furthermore, in vitro antioxidant activity of the herbs was also evaluated. Induction of diabetes mellitus in rats caused an increase in blood lipid peroxide levels that was associated with the reduced activity of red blood cell (RBC) antioxidant enzymes--namely, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione peroxidase--along with depletion of plasma reduced glutathione (GSH) and copper, zinc, iron, magnesium, and selenium levels. Oral treatment of diabetic rats with Allium sativum, Azadirachta indica, Momordica charantia, and Ocimum sanctum extracts (500 mg/kg of body weight) not only lowered the blood glucose level but also inhibited the formation of lipid peroxides, reactivated the antioxidant enzymes, and restored levels of GSH and metals in the above-mentioned model. The herbal extracts (50-500 microg) inhibited the generation of superoxide anions (O(2)(-.)) in both enzymatic and nonenzymatic in vitro systems. These preparations also inhibited the ferrous-sodium ascorbate-induced formation of lipid peroxides in RBCs. The in vivo and in vitro protective effects of the above-mentioned herbal drugs were also compared with that of glibenclamide. On the basis of our results, we conclude that the above-mentioned herbal plants not only possess hypoglycemic properties, but they also decrease oxidative load in diabetes mellitus. Therefore, we propose that long-term use of such agents might help in the prevention of diabetes-associated complications. However, the extrapolation of these results to humans needs further in-depth study.",

The hypoglycaemic effect observed with combination of rosiglitazone and MC was significantly more compared to either of the drugs given alone. MC also augmented the hypoglycaemic effect of rosiglitazone in both STZ induced diabetes in adult animals and STZ induced diabetes in neonatal rats.

Adult male albino rats of Wistar strain, weighing 180 to 200 g, were induced diabetes by administration of STZ (40 mg/kg b.w.) intraperitoneally. The normal and diabetic rats were treated with UMB dissolved in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for 45 days. In our study, diabetic rats had decreased plasma insulin and elevated blood glucose, sialic acid, total hoxoses, fucose, and hexosamines in the plasma and tissues. Treatment with UMB brought the levels of glucose, sialic acid, total hoxoses, fucose, and hexosamines to near-normal level. Thus, our results show that treatment with UMB has improved glycemic control and thereby reduced the formation of glycoprotein components. This leads to the normalization of circulatory and tissue sialic acid, fucose, hexoses, and hexosamines in STZ-diabetic rats, which reflects a protective effect of UMB from the risk of diabetic complications.",

        "Momordica charantia L., commonly known as bitter gourd, is used as a vegetable by the Asian community in Africa. It is frequently used as an antidiabetic herb for the management of the disease in the Ayurvedic system of medicine. The present study was aimed at evaluating the effects of M. charantia on glucose level, lipid profiles, and oxidative stress in diabetic rats subjected to a sucrose load. Five normal rats and 20 diabetic rats (diabetes induced by injecting alloxan monohydrate) were used for the experiment. Diabetic rats were divided into four groups: three experimental groups that received sucrose (4 g/kg of body weight) plus graded doses of M. charantia extract and a diabetic control group that received only sucrose (4 g/kg of body weight). Normal rats were used as the normal control group and received only sucrose (4 kg/kg of body weight). The experiment was run for 30 days, after which rats were bled to assay blood glucose, lipid profiles, and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and reduced glutathione. After this, all treatments were terminated. Rats in the normal control group, diabetic control group, and experimental group 3 were subjected to observation for 30 days and were bled on day 31 to assay parameters as stated above. Results indicated that M. charantia maintained the normal glucose levels in all experimental groups, reduced triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein levels, and increased high-density lipoprotein levels. It also improved the antioxidant status, indicated by low levels of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and normal levels of reduced glutathione. Rats reverted to diabetic conditions and were found to be under oxidative stress after termination of treatment. This study concludes that M. charantia maintains the normal glucose level, lipid profiles, and antioxidant condition in diabetic rats against the sucrose load.",

        "Bitter gourd (BG, Momordica charantia) exerts proven blood glucose- and body weight-lowering effects. To develop an effective and safe application, it is necessary to identify the bioactive compounds and biochemical mechanisms responsible for these effects in type 2 diabetes. A total of forty-five 4-week-old male db/db mice were assigned to five groups of nine each. The mice were given sterile tap water as a control, a whole fruit powder, the lipid fraction, the saponin fraction or the hydrophilic residue of BG at a daily oral dosage of 150 mg/kg body weight for 5 weeks, respectively. Weight gain was significantly decreased in all the BG-treated groups (P </= 0.05). Glycated Hb levels were the highest in the control mice compared with all the four BG-treated mice (P = 0.02). The lipid fraction had the strongest effect, and it tended (P = 0.075) to reduce glycated Hb levels from 9.3 % (control mice) to 8.0 % (lipid fraction-treated mice). The lipid and saponin fractions reduced lipid peroxidation of adipose tissue significantly (P </= 0.01). Additionally, the saponin fraction and the lipid fraction reduced protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP 1B) activity in skeletal muscle cytosol by 25 % (P = 0.05) and 23 % (P = 0.07), respectively. PTP 1B is the physiological antagonist of the insulin signalling pathway. Inhibition of PTP 1B increases insulin sensitivity. This is the first study to demonstrate that BG is involved in PTP 1B regulation, and thus explains one possible biochemical mechanism underlying the antidiabetic effects of BG in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.",

        "Oxidative stress is currently suggested to play a major role in the development of diabetes mellitus. There is an increasing demand of natural anti-diabetic agents, as continuous administration of existing drugs and insulin are associated with many side effects and toxicity. The present study was aimed to investigate the effect of Momordica charantia (MC) and Trigonella foenum graecum (TFG) extracts (aqueous) on antioxidant status and lipid peroxidation in heart tissue of normal and alloxan induced diabetic rats.

        "The aim of this research was to determine the effects of Momordica charantia (MC) fruit aqueous extract on pancreatic histopathological changes in neonatal STZ-induced type-II diabetic rats. Diabetes mellitus was induced in one day Sprague-Dawley neonatal rats using a single intrapretoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) (85 mg/kg body weight) and monitored for 12 weeks thereafter. The diabetic rats were separated into three groups, as follows: the diabetic control group (i.e. nSTZ), the diabetic group (i.e. nSTZ/M) - which was orally given 20 mg/kg of MC fruit extract, and the diabetic group (i.e. nSTZ/G) - that was treated with glibenclamide, 0.1 mg/kg for a period of four weeks. At the end of treatment, the animals were sacrificed and blood samples were collected from the saphenous vein to measure the blood glucose and serum insulin level. The pancreatic specimens were removed and processed for light microscopy, electron microscopy examination and immunohistochemical study. The results of this study showed that MC fruit aqueous extract reduced the blood glucose level as well as glibenclamide and increased the serum insulin level in the treated diabetic rats (P<0.05). The fruit extract of MC alleviated pancreatic damage and increased the number of beta-cells in the diabetic treated rats (P<0.05). Our results suggest that oral feeding of MC fruit extract may have a significant role in the renewal of pancreatic beta-cells in the nSTZ rats.",

Momordica charantia (family: Cucurbitaceae) and Trigonella foenum graecum (family: Fabaceae) are used traditionally in Indian folk medicine to manage diabetes mellitus. In the present study, the anti-hyperglycemic and anti-oxidative potential of aqueous extracts of M. charantia pulp and seed powder of T. foenum graecum were assessed in alloxan (150 mg/kg body weight) induced diabetic rats. Alloxan treatment to the rats could induce diabetes as the fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels were > 280 mg/dl. Treatment of diabetic rats for 30 days with M. charantia and T. foenum graecum could significantly (p < 0.001) improve the FBG levels to near normal glucose levels. Antioxidant activities (superoxide dismutase, catalase, reduced glutathione content and glutathione-s-transferase) and lipid peroxidation levels were measured in heart, kidney and liver tissues of normal, diabetic and experimental animals (diabetics + treatment). TBARS levels were significantly (p < 0.001) higher and anti-oxidative activities were found low in diabetic group, as compared to the control group. Significant (p < 0.001) improvement in both the TBARS levels and antioxidant activities were observed when M. charantia and T. foenum graecum were given to diabetic rats. Our results clearly demonstrate that M. charantia and T. foenum graecum are not only useful in controlling the blood glucose levels, but also have antioxidant potential to protect vital organs such as heart and kidney against damage caused due to diabetes induced oxidative stress.",

        2011,
        "Diabetes is usually associated with inflammation. Inflammation contributes to the development of diabetes. Traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) play an important role in lowering blood glucose and controlling inflammation. Many studies show that TCM with hypoglycaemic effects, for example Radix Astragali, Radix Rehmanniae, Radix Trichosanthis, Panax Ginseng, Fructus Schisandrae, Radix Ophiopogonis, Rhizoma Anemarrhenae, Radix Puerariae, Fructus Lycii, Poria, Rhizoma Coptidis, Rhizoma Dioscoreae, Rhizoma Polygonati, Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae, Radix Glycyrrhizae, Semen Trigonellae, Momordica charantia, Allium sativum, Opuntia stricta, Aloe vera, Cortex Cinnamomi, Rhizoma Curcumae Longae, and so on, have nearly independent anti-inflammatory action. Antihyperglycaemic compounds, for example berberine, puerarin, quercetin, ferulic acid, astragaloside IV, curcumin, epigallocatechin gallate, resveratrol, tetrandrine, glycyrrhizin, emodin and baicalin, used in TCM also have anti-inflammatory effects. These studies suggest that TCM might exert hypoglycaemic effects that are partly mediated by the anti-inflammatory mechanisms. However, small amounts of TCM with potent anti-inflammatory action does not have any hypoglycaemic effect. This indirectly indicates that diabetes may be a low-grade inflammatory disease and potent regulation of inflammatory mediators may not be required. Studies of TCM add new evidences, which indicate that diabetes may be an inflammatory disease and slight or moderate inhibition of inflammation might be useful to prevent the development of diabetes. Through this review, we aim to develop more perspectives to indicate that diabetes may be an inflammatory disease and diverse TCM may share a common antidiabetic property: anti-inflammatory action. Further studies should focus on and validate inflammation-regulating targets of TCM that may be involved in inhibiting the development of diabetes.",

        "Bioactive components from bitter melon (BM) have been reported to improve glucose metabolism in vivo, but definitive studies on efficacy and mechanism of action are lacking. We sought to investigate the effects of BM bioactives on body weight, muscle lipid content and insulin signaling in mice fed a high-fat diet and on insulin signaling in L6 myotubes. Male C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into low-fat diet control (LFD), high-fat diet (HFD) and HFD plus BM (BM) groups. Body weight, body composition, plasma glucose, leptin, insulin and muscle lipid profile were determined over 12 weeks. Insulin signaling was determined in the mouse muscle taken at end of study and in L6 myotubes exposed to the extract. Body weight, plasma glucose, insulin, leptin levels and HOMA-IR values were significantly lower in the BM-fed HFD group when compared to the HFD group. BM supplementation significantly increased IRS-2, IR beta, PI 3K and GLUT4 protein abundance in skeletal muscle, as well as phosphorylation of IRS-1, Akt1 and Akt2 when compared with HFD (P<.05 and P<.01). BM also significantly reduced muscle lipid content in the HFD mice. BM extract greatly increased glucose uptake and enhanced insulin signaling in L6 myotubes. This study shows that BM bioactives reduced body weight, improved glucose metabolism and enhanced skeletal muscle insulin signaling. A contributing mechanism to the enhanced insulin signaling may be associated with the reduction in skeletal muscle lipid content. Nutritional supplementation with this extract, if validated for human studies, may offer an adjunctive therapy for diabetes.",

        "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder caused by insufficient or inefficient insulin secretary response and it is characterized by increased blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia). DM is a heterogonous group of syndromes. Glucose is the main energy source for the body, and in the case of DM, management of glucose becomes irregular. There are three key defects in the onset of hyperglycemia in DM, namely increased hepatic glucose production, diminished insulin secretion, and impaired insulin action. Conventional drugs treat diabetes by improving insulin sensitivity, increasing insulin production and/or decreasing the amount of glucose in blood. This article provides a comprehensive review of the mode of action of most popular hypoglycemic herbs, such as ginseng, bitter melon, fenugreek, banaba, Gymnema sylvestre and Coptis chinensis. The herbs act by increasing insulin secretion, enhancing glucose uptake by adipose and skeletal muscle tissues, inhibiting intestinal glucose absorption and inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Although evidence from animals and humans consistently supports the therapeutic effect of these phytomedicines, multicenter large-scale clinical trials have not been conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of these herbal medicines and their interaction with conventional drugs when administered simultaneously.",

        2011,
        "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the oldest known human disease currently affecting more than 200 million people worldwide. Diabetes mellitus is derived from two Greek words meaning siphon and sugar. In DM, patients have high blood level of glucose and this passes out with urine. This is because the endocrine pancreas does not produce either or not enough insulin or the insulin which is produced is not exerting its biochemical effect (or insulin resistance) effectively. Insulin is a major metabolic hormone which has numerous functions in the body and one main role is to stimulate glucose uptake into body's cells where it is utilized to provide energy. The disease is classified into type 1 and type 2 DM. Type 1 DM develops when the insulin producing beta cells have been destroyed and are unable to produce insulin. This is very common in children and is treated with insulin. Type 2 DM (T2DM) develops when the body is unable to produce an adequate amount of insulin or the insulin which is provided does not work efficiently. This is due to life style habits including unhealthy diet, obesity, lack of exercise and hereditary and environmental factors. Some symptoms of DM include excess urination, constant thirst, lethargy, weight loss, itching, decreased digestive enzyme secretion, slow wound healing and other related symptoms. If left untreated, DM can result in severe long-term complications such as kidney and heart failure, stroke, blindness, nerve damage, exocrine glands insufficiency and other forms of complications. T2DM can be treated and controlled by prescribed drugs, regular exercise, diet (including some plant-based food) and general change in life style habits. This review is concerned with the role of plant-based medicine to treat DM. One such plant is Momordica charantia which is grown in tropical countries worldwide and it has been used as a traditional herbal medicine for thousands of years although its origin in unknown. This review examines the medicinal chemistry and use(s) of M. charantia and its various extracts and compounds, their biochemical properties and how they act as anti-diabetic (hypoglycemic) drugs and the various mechanisms by which they exert their beneficial effects in controlling and treating DM.",

Information regarding the standardization of this vegetable for its usage as an antidiabetic drug is scanty. There are many reports on its effects on glucose and lipid levels in diabetic animals and some in clinical trials. Reports regarding its mechanism of action are limited. So in the present review all the information is considered to produce some concrete findings on the mechanism behind its hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects. Studies have shown that M. charantia repairs damaged beta-cells, increases insulin levels, and also enhance the sensitivity of insulin. It inhibits the absorption of glucose by inhibiting glucosidase and also suppresses the activity of disaccharidases in the intestine. It stimulates the synthesis and release of thyroid hormones and adiponectin and enhances the activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Effects of M. charantia like transport of glucose in the cells, transport of fatty acids in the mitochondria, modulation of insulin secretion, and elevation of levels of uncoupling proteins in adipose and skeletal muscles are similar to those of AMPK and thyroxine. Therefore it is proposed that effects of M. charantia on carbohydrate and fat metabolism are through thyroxine and AMPK.",

As regards diagnosis, subjects with HbA(1c) greater or equal to 6.5% on admission may be considered diabetic while, in those with no known diabetes and HbA(1c) less than 6.5%, it is recommended that an OGTT be performed 7 to 28 days after ACS. During hospitalization in the ICU, continuous insulin treatment should be initiated in all patients when admission blood glucose levels are greater or equal to 180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L) and, in those with previously known diabetes, when preprandial glucose levels are greater or equal to 140 mg/dL (7.77 mmol/L) during follow-up. The recommended blood glucose target is 140-180 mg/dL (7.7-10 mmol/L) for most patients. Following the ICU period, insulin treatment is not mandatory for every patient, and other antidiabetic treatments may be considered, with the choice of optimal treatment depending on the metabolic profile of the patient. Patients should be referred to a diabetologist before discharge from hospital in cases of unknown diabetes diagnosed during ACS hospitalization, of HbA(1c) greater or equal to 8% at the time of admission, or newly introduced insulin therapy or severe/repeated hypoglycaemia. Referral to a diabetologist after hospital discharge is recommended if diabetes is diagnosed by the OGTT, or during cardiac rehabilitation in cases of uncontrolled diabetes (HbA(1c) >/= 8%) or severe/repeated hypoglycaemia.",

For purpose of comparison, a comparable study was conducted in normal rats. Both the immediate and long-term effects of the plant extracts were assessed in rats injected daily, up to 3 weeks after the start of the experiments. The results of this study reinforce the view that both a crude aqueous extract and a n-butanol extract from the Citrullus colocynthis L. seeds may represent the best candidates in order to eventually identify a component suitable for the treatment of both type-1 and type-2 diabetic subjects.",

The animals were divided into diabetic and nondiabetic control groups. The duration of each experiment lasted from 1 week to 1 month, and the results were compared with that of the standard hypoglycemic drug glibenclamide (10 mg/kg), which was given once daily. In this study, biochemical and histopathological parameters were studied in streptozotacin (STZ) (single intraperitoneal injection of 55 mg/kg)-induced diabetic rats. The diabetic rats showed a significant (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01) decrease in their body weight and serum amylase with marked elevation in blood glucose, serum cholesterol, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, and serum transaminases (AST and ALT) after 1 week till the 28th day of diabetes. Cytotoxicity of MAC-ST/001 formulation was also studied on C2C12, 3T3-L1, and HepG2 cells through MTT assay. Histological examination of the liver and pancreas of normal control, diabetic control, and drug-treated rats revealed significant results.

        "glucose - High-fat diet induces periodontitis in mice through lipopolysaccharides (LPS) receptor signaling: protective action of estrogens.",
        2012,
        "BACKGROUND: A fat-enriched diet favors the development of gram negative bacteria in the intestine which is linked to the occurrence of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Interestingly, some pathogenic gram negative bacteria are commonly associated with the development of periodontitis which, like T2D, is characterized by a chronic low-grade inflammation. Moreover, estrogens have been shown to regulate glucose homeostasis via an LPS receptor dependent immune-modulation. In this study, we evaluated whether diet-induced metabolic disease would favor the development of periodontitis in mice. In addition, the regulatory role of estrogens in this process was assessed. METHODS: Four-week-old C57BL6/J WT and CD14 (part of the TLR-4 machinery for LPS-recognition) knock-out female mice were ovariectomised and subcutaneously implanted with pellets releasing either placebo or 17beta-estradiol (E2). Mice were then fed with either a normal chow or a high-fat diet for four weeks. The development of diabetes was monitored by an intraperitoneal glucose-tolerance test and plasma insulin concentration while periodontitis was assessed by identification of pathogens, quantification of periodontal soft tissue inflammation and alveolar bone loss. RESULTS: The fat-enriched diet increased the prevalence of periodontal pathogenic microbiota like Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella intermedia, gingival inflammation and alveolar bone loss. E2 treatment prevented this effect and CD14 knock-out mice resisted high-fat diet-induced periodontal defects. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data show that mice fed with a diabetogenic diet developed defects and microflora of tooth supporting-tissues typically associated with periodontitis. Moreover, our results suggest a causal link between the activation of the LPS pathway on innate immunity by periodontal microbiota and HFD-induced periodontitis, a pathophysiological mechanism that could be targeted by estrogens.",

        "Unripe fruit, seeds and aerial parts of Momordica charantia Linn. (Cucurbitaceae) have been used in various parts of the world to treat diabetes. Oral administration of the fruit juice or seed powder causes a reduction in fasting blood glucose and improves glucose tolerance in normal and diabetic animals and in humans. Animal and in vitro data support both insulin secretagogue and insulinomimetic activity of the fruit. However, enhanced insulin levels in vivo in response to its administration have not been observed. Although a wide range of compounds have been isolated from Momordica charantia, notably steroidal compounds and proteins, the orally active antidiabetic principle has not been adequately identified. A polypeptide, p-insulin, produces hypoglycaemic effects in humans and animals on subcutaneous injection, but oral activity is questionable. Other reported hypoglycaemic principles from Momordica charantia include the sterol glucoside mixture charantin (fruit) and the pyrimidine nucleoside vicine (seeds). However these are only effective at doses too high to account for all the activity of the plant extract. Principal toxicity of Momordica charantia in animals is to the liver and reproductive system. These effects have not been reported in humans despite widespread use of the fruit medicinally and as a vegetable.",

Furthermore, BLSP protected pancreatic tissues including islet beta cells and reduced the loss of islet cells. Combined with the difference of compositions in BLSP and BAP, it could be concluded that superfine grinding and lyophilization processes were beneficial for presenting the antidiabetic activity, which will provide a reference for direct utilization of bitter melon as a suitable functional food to relieve symptoms of diabetes.",

Fasting blood glucose levels were evaluated before and after administration of different fractions of the seed extract. Among the three fractions tested, fraction Mc-3 (15 mg/kg b.wt.) showed the maximum anti-hyperglycemic activity and reduced blood glucose levels in experimental diabetic rats significantly. The activities of the key regulatory enzymes of glucose metabolism (hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) were determined in Mc-3-treated diabetic animals. Once-daily administration of the fraction Mc-3 for prolonged period of 18 days to the experimental diabetic animals did not result in any nephrotoxicity or hepatotoxicity as evident from insignificant changes in biochemical parameters indicative of liver and kidney functions. Further fractionation of the fraction Mc-3 by size exclusion chromatography resulted in a fraction, designated Mc-3.2, possessing anti-hyperglycemic activity. The fraction Mc-3.2 showed the presence of a predominant protein band of ~11 kDa on SDS-PAGE. Loss in anti-hyperglycemic activity of the Mc-3.2 upon protease treatment indicates the proteinaceous nature of the anti-hyperglycemic principles. Overall, the results suggest that Momordica charantia seeds contain an effective anti-hyperglycemic protein(s) which may find application in treatment of diabetes without evident toxic effects.",

        "Diabetes mellitus is one of the common metabolic disorders acquiring around 2.8% of the world's population and is anticipated to cross 5.4% by the year 2025. Since long back herbal medicines have been the highly esteemed source of medicine therefore, they have become a growing part of modern, high-tech medicine. In view of the above aspects the present review provides profiles of plants (65 species) with hypoglycaemic properties, available through literature source from various database with proper categorization according to the parts used, mode of reduction in blood glucose (insulinomimetic or insulin secretagogues activity) and active phytoconstituents having insulin mimetics activity. From the review it was suggested that, plant showing hypoglycemic potential mainly belongs to the family Leguminoseae, Lamiaceae, Liliaceae, Cucurbitaceae, Asteraceae, Moraceae, Rosaceae and Araliaceae. The most active plants are Allium sativum, Gymnema sylvestre, Citrullus colocynthis, Trigonella foenum greacum, Momordica charantia and Ficus bengalensis. The review describes some new bioactive drugs and isolated compounds from plants such as roseoside, epigallocatechin gallate, beta-pyrazol-1-ylalanine, cinchonain Ib, leucocyandin 3-O-beta-d-galactosyl cellobioside, leucopelargonidin-3- O-alpha-L rhamnoside, glycyrrhetinic acid, dehydrotrametenolic acid, strictinin, isostrictinin, pedunculagin, epicatechin and christinin-A showing significant insulinomimetic and antidiabetic activity with more efficacy than conventional hypoglycaemic agents. Thus, from the review majorly, the antidiabetic activity of medicinal plants is attributed to the presence of polyphenols, flavonoids, terpenoids, coumarins and other constituents which show reduction in blood glucose levels. The review also discusses the management aspect of diabetes mellitus using these plants and their active principles.",

Marketed herbal drugs comprise of irrational combinations, which makes their quality control more difficult. Phytoconstituents, despite having excellent bioactivity in vitro demonstrate less or no in vivo actions due to their poor lipid solubility, resulting in high therapeutic dose regimen; phospholipids encapsulation can overcome this problem. Hence, present study was designed to develop a phospholipids encapsulated polyherbal anti-diabetic formulation. In the present study, polyherbal formulation comprises of lyophilized hydro-alcoholic (50% v/v) extracts of Momordica charantia, Trigonella foenum-graecum and Withania somnifera 2:2:1, respectively, named HA, optimized based on oral glucose tolerance test model in normal Wistar rats. The optimized formulation (HA) entrapped in the phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol (8:2) vesicle system is named HA lipids (HAL). The vesicles were characterized for shape, morphology, entrapment efficiency, polar-dispersity index and release profile in the gastric pH. The antidiabetic potential of HA, marketed polyherbal formulation (D-fit) and HAL was compared in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat model of 21 days study. The parameters evaluated were behavioral changes, body weight, serum glucose level, lipid profile and oxidative stress. The antidiabetic potential of HA (1000 mg/kg) was at par with the D-fit (1000 mg/kg). However, the potential was enhanced by phospholipids encapsulation; as HAL (500 mg/kg) has shown more significant (P < 0.05) potential in comparison to HA (1000 mg/kg) and at par with metformin (500 mg/kg).",

        "Diabetes mellitus is an endocrinological disorder arising from insulin deficiency or due to ineffectiveness of the insulin produced by the body. This results in high blood glucose and with time, to neurological, cardiovascular, retinal and renal complications. It is a debilitating disease and affects the population of every country of the world. Around 200 million people of the world suffer from this disease and this figure is projected to rise to 300 million in the coming years. The disease cannot be cured with allopathic medicine as the drugs used do not restore normal glucose homeostasis and moreover have side-effects. On the other hand, traditional medicinal practitioners of various countries claim to cure diabetes or at least alleviate the major symptoms and progression of this disease through administration of medicinal plants. The Garos are an indigenous community of Bangladesh, who still follow their traditional medicinal practices. Their traditional medicinal formulations contain a number of plants, which they claim to be active antidiabetic agents. Since observation of indigenous practices have led to discovery of many modern drugs, it was the objective of the present study to conduct a survey among the Marakh sect of the Garos residing in Mymensingh district of Bangladesh to find out the medicinal plants that they use for treatment of diabetes. It was found that the tribal practitioners of the Marakh sect of the Garos use twelve medicinal plants for treatment of diabetes. These plants were Lannea coromandelica, Alstonia scholaris, Catharanthus roseus, Enhydra fluctuans, Terminalia chebula, Coccinia grandis, Momordica charantia, Cuscuta reflexa, Phyllanthus emblica, Syzygium aqueum, Drynaria quercifolia, and Clerodendrum viscosum.

Recently, a novel protein termed as ADMc1 from the seed extract of M. charantia has been identified and isolated showing significant antihyperglycemic activity in type 1 diabetic rats in which diabetes was induced. However, the structure of this protein has not yet been analyzed. Homology modeling approach was used to generate a high quality protein 3D structure for the amino acid sequence of the ADMc1 protein in this study. The comparative assessment of secondary structures revealed ADMc1 as an all-alpha helix protein with random coils. Tertiary structure predicted on the template structure of Napin of B. Napus (PDB ID: 1SM7) with which the ADMc1 showed significant sequence similarity, was validated using protein structure validation tools like PROCHECK, WHAT_CHECK, VERIFY3D and ProSA. Arrangement of disulfide bridges formed by cysteine residues were predicted by the Dianna 1.1 server. The presence of multiple disulfide bond confers the stable nature of the ADMc1 protein. Further, the biological activity of the ADMc1 was assessed in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice which are spontaneous model of type 1 diabetes. Significant reduction in the blood glucose levels of NOD mice was observed up to 8 h post administration of the rADMc1 protein.

In these areas, bitter gourd (Momordica charantia) is a popular vegetable which is traditionally known to have health beneficial effects not only, but mainly, on diabetes. Bitter gourd could be a cheap possibility to help the poor in these and other countries to control their blood glucose levels. This review describes anti-diabetic effects of bitter gourd reported in the literature and discusses what still needs to be clarified for developing an evidence-based and safe use of the bitter gourd for diabetes. Analyses of bioactive compounds have shown that bitter gourd is rich in nutrients and phytochemicals of which some have anti-diabetic effects. Juices, powders, extracts, and isolated compounds have been tested in vitro and in vivo. Bitter gourd increases insulin secretion of the pancreas, decreases intestinal glucose uptake, and increases uptake and utilization of glucose in peripheral tissues. Although human studies with type 2 diabetics are weak in their design and/or results, some of the studies do indicate anti-diabetic effects in patients and safety for bitter gourd treatment in humans. In the future, well designed studies with rodents will help to understand what kind of bitter gourd variety, dosage, preparation, and duration of administration is optimal. Such results will help to design human studies which are necessary to prove the effectiveness of bitter gourd in patients.",

        "BACKGROUND: Achieving recommended glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c ) targets in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) requires effective control of fasting and post-prandial plasma glucose. As T2DM progresses, oral anti-diabetics are no longer sufficient to maintain glycaemic control. Five phase III studies in the GetGoal clinical trial programme assessed the efficacy of lixisenatide, a once-daily prandial glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, in combination with oral anti-diabetics in patients with T2DM insufficiently controlled using oral anti-diabetics. METHODS: A meta-analysis was performed of the results of five 24-week clinical trials (comprising 2760 patients) concerning lixisenatide or placebo plus oral anti-diabetic therapy. The primary endpoint of these studies was change in HbA1c at week 24. Changes in fasting and post-prandial plasma glucose, and weight were also established as were the odds ratios for hypoglycaemia and composite safety and efficacy endpoints. Meta-analysis outcomes were assessed using a random effects model. All meta-analyses were performed using RevMan, version 5.1. RESULTS: Lixisenatide was significantly better than placebo in terms of achieving all endpoints in this meta-analysis, including the primary endpoint change in HbA1c at week 24, with p < 0.0001 for all endpoints. The mean number of symptomatic hypoglycaemic events per patient year was increased for patients in the lixisenatide versus placebo groups (p = 0.04). However, compared with patients in the placebo group, patients treated with lixisenatide were more likely to achieve composite efficacy and safety endpoints. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis demonstrates that lixisenatide in combination with oral anti-diabetic therapy significantly improves outcomes combining efficacy and safety parameters in patients with T2DM.",

We investigated the differences in the anti-diabetic properties and mechanism of action of Taiwanese M. charantia (MC) between type 1 diabetic (T1D) and type 2 diabetic (T2D) mice. To clarify the beneficial effects of MC, we measured non-fasting glucose, oral glucose tolerance, and plasma insulin levels in KK/HIJ mice with high-fat diet-induced diabetes (200 mg/kg/day of charantin-rich extract of MC [CEMC]) and in ICR mice with STZ-induced diabetes. After 8 weeks, all the mice were exsanguinated, and the expression of the insulin-signaling-associated proteins in their tissue was evaluated, in coordination with the protective effects of CEMC against pancreatic beta-cell toxicity (in vitro). Eight weeks of data indicated that CEMC caused a significant decline in non-fasting blood glucose, plasma glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance in the KK/HIJ mice, but not in the ICR mice. Furthermore, CEMC decreased plasma insulin and promoted the sensitivity of insulin by increasing the expression of GLUT4 in the skeletal muscle and of IRS-1 in the liver of KK/HIJ mice; however, CEMC extract had no effect on the insulin sensitivity of ICR mice. In vitro study showed that CEMC prevented pancreatic beta cells from high-glucose-induced cytotoxicity after 24 h of incubation, but the protective effect was not detectable after 72 h. Collectively, the hypoglycemic effects of CEMC suggest that it has potential for increasing insulin sensitivity in patients with T2D rather than for protecting patients with T1D against beta-cell dysfunction.",

In the presence of kikar extract (100mug/ml), an increase of 228% in insulin release was recorded compared to the control (5.6mM glucose) whereas that was 270% and 367% in the presence of kikar and jamun extracts (500mug/ml), respectively. 3T3-L1 cells treated with jamun extract (100mug/ml) exhibited the highest increase in glucose consumption by the cells (94%, compared with the control) followed by harad (53%) and fenugreek (50%) extracts. A significant inhibitory effect of the fenugreek, kikar and jamun extracts on glucose diffusion across a dialysis membrane suggested that these extracts could partly act by decreasing glucose absorption in the small intestine. The results showed that a combination of these plants in diet could help in the management of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.",

        "Current studies have elaborated diabetes mellitus as one of the most prevalent endocrine disorder throughout the world. Citrullus colocynthis (C. colocynthis) is one of the most common traditional plants used as remedy against diabetes mellitus. It is well recognized by its hypoglycemic effect, which is substantiated in current phytotherapy. Its undesired effects include the disturbance of gastrointestinal and urinary tracts. This review article encompasses various blood glucose lowering studies that have been carried out till date. Various parts of plants used in extract preparation were roots, fruits, seeds, rinds and leaves. The nature of these extracts was ethnolic, methanolic, or aqueous and their doses varied from 10 to 500 mg/kg body weight/day. All these published articles elaborate C. colocynthis as a potential antiglycemic medicinal plant.",

        "In diabetes mellitus, cardiac fibrosis is characterized by increase in the deposition of collagen fibers. The present study aimed to observe the effect of Momordica charantia (MC) fruit extract on hyperglycaemia-induced cardiac fibrosis. Diabetes was induced in the male Sprague-Dawley rats with a single intravenous injection of streptozotocin (STZ). Following 4 weeks of STZ induction, the rats were subdivided (n = 6) into control group (Ctrl), control group treated with MC (Ctrl-MC), diabetic untreated group (DM-Ctrl), diabetic group treated with MC (DM-MC), and diabetic group treated with 150 mg/kg of metformin (DM-Met). Administration of MC fruit extract (1.5 g/kg body weight) in diabetic rats for 28 days showed significant increase in the body weight and decrease in the fasting blood glucose level. Significant increase in cardiac tissues superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione contents (GSH), and catalase (CAT) was observed following MC treatment. Hydroxyproline content was significantly reduced and associated morphological damages reverted to normal. The decreased expression of type III and type IV collagens was observed under immunohistochemical staining. It is concluded that MC fruit extract possesses antihyperglycemic, antioxidative, and cardioprotective properties which may be beneficial in the treatment of diabetic cardiac fibrosis.",

        2015,
        "Bitter melon (BM; Momordica charantia) has been used as a treatment method for various diseases including cancer and diabetes. The objective of this study was to investigate whether BM has preventive effects against insulin resistance and diabetes and to identify the underlying mechanism by which BM ameliorates insulin resistance in obese and diabetic rats. The rats were separated into three groups as follows: (a) high-fat (HF) diet control, (b) HF diet and 1% BM and (c) HF diet and 3% BM. After 6 weeks of assigned treatments, body weight and food intake were not altered by BM administration. Bitter melon treatment significantly improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. The levels of proinflammatory cytokines were significantly down-regulated in liver, muscle and epididymal fats from BM-treated rats. The activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) in the liver and muscle was decreased by BM compared with HF controls. The 3% BM supplementation significantly increased the levels of phospho-insulin receptor substrate-1 (Tyr612) and phospho-Akt (Ser473). It also significantly decreased the levels of phospho-NF-kappaB (p65) (Ser536) and phospho-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (Thr183/Tyr185) in liver, muscle and epididymal fats. The findings of this study indicate that BM exerted preventive effects against insulin resistance and diabetes through the modulation of NF-kappaB and JNK pathways. Therefore, BM may be useful in the prevention of insulin resistance and diabetes.",

        2014,
        "BACKGROUND: Mormordica charantia (bitter melon) has been investigated for lowering plasma glucose in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). Previous data has offered inconclusive and inconsistent results about the benefits of bitter melon in patients with DM. Our current project aims to determine whether bitter melon has a favorable effect in lowering plasma glucose in patients with DM. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library from inception to July 2013 without any language restrictions for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating bitter melon to no treatment in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Study selection, data extraction and validity of each article were independently assessed by two investigators. Articles were appraised for proper random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, selective reporting and completeness of outcomes reporting to assess the risk for biases. The glycemic results of each RCT were analyzed to yield weighted mean differences (WMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: A total of four RCTs, each with 40-66 participants, followed between 4 and 12 weeks were identified in this meta-analysis. Overall risk of bias for each article included was determined to be unclear. In total, 208 participants with type 2 DM (mean age of 56.5 years) were evaluated. Compared with no treatment, bitter melon did not significantly lower A1C (WMD -0.13%, 95% CI -0.41 to 0.16) nor fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 47 (WMD 2.23 mg dl(-1), 95% CI -14.91 to 19.37).

The present study aims to asses and compare the hypoglycemic and antiatherogenic effects as well as the safety of two different doses of bitter melon with glibenclamide. METHODS: A total of 95 participants were randomized into 3 groups; group I and group II received bitter melon (2 g/day and 4 g/day respectively) and group III received glibenclamide (5 mg/day) for 10 weeks. Glycemic control and antiatherogenic effects were determined by assessing glycohemoglobin (HbA1-c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2 hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), plasma sialic acid (PSA), systolic blood pressure (SBP), blood lipids and atherogenic index at different time periods. RESULTS: Compared to baseline, mean reduction in HbA1-c at the endpoint was significant among patients of group I, group II and group III (p </= 0.05, p </= 0.02 and p < 0.005 respectively) and same was the case for FPG (p </= 0.05, p < 0.04, p < 0.003 respectively), but the improvement in 2 hour OGTT was significant only in group III (p < 0.03). The decrease in PSA was observed only among group I and group II with the later showing significant reduction from baseline (p < 0.01). In group III, the level slightly increased. Parameters including blood lipids, atherogenic index, body weight and SBP improved among patients of group I and group II but deteriorated among group III patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our study concludes that bitter melon has a weaker hypoglycemic effect but ameliorates the diabetes associated cardiovascular (CV) risk factors more effectively than glibenclamide.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors constitute a novel therapeutic class indicated for type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients, and are already on the market in a few countries in Europe. They decrease glycaemia mainly by enhancing glucose excretion in urine by reducing renal glucose reabsorption via the action of SGLT2 in the kidneys. In general, they are well tolerated, but their mode of action results in specific side effects as well as an increased risk of genital (vulvovaginitis and balanitis) and urinary tract infections, for which T2D patients are already at high risk, reported within the first 6 months of treatment. Usually these infectious events are successfully treated with standard therapies, but diabetologists are not accustomed to dealing with them.

METHODS: This observational, prospective, multicenter study included 3152 adults with type 2 diabetes who had recently started or were about to start liraglutide treatment. During 2 years of follow-up, an evaluation of the reasons for prescribing liraglutide, maintenance dose of liraglutide, changes in combined antidiabetic treatments, level of glycemic control, change in body weight and body mass index (BMI), patient satisfaction with diabetes treatment and safety of liraglutide were investigated. The primary study endpoint was the proportion of patients still receiving liraglutide and presenting with HbA1c <7.0% after 2 years of follow-up. RESULTS: At the end of the study, 29.5% of patients maintained liraglutide treatment and reached the HbA(1c) target. Mean (+/-SD) HbA(1c), fasting plasma glucose concentration, body weight and BMI were significantly reduced from baseline [8.46% (+/-1.46) to 7.44% (+/-1.20); 180 (+/-60) to 146 (+/-44) mg/dL; 95.2 (+/-20.0) to 91.1 (+/-19.6) kg; 34.0 (+/-7.2) to 32.5 (+/-6.9) kg/m(2); respectively, all P < 0.0001]. Patient treatment satisfaction increased, with the mean diabetes treatment satisfaction questionnaire status version score increasing from 22.17 (+/-7.64) to 28.55 (+/-5.79), P < 0.0001. The main adverse event type was gastrointestinal, with a frequency of 10.9%, and the percentage of patients suffering >/=1 hypoglycemic episode decreased from 6.9% to 4.4%. CONCLUSION: The results of the EVIDENCE study suggest that the effectiveness of liraglutide in real-world clinical practice is similar to that observed in randomized controlled trials.

        "BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a rapidly growing health concern in Sri Lanka. Diet and physical activity are important modifiable risk factors affecting the incidence, severity and management of DM. The present study aims to evaluate the knowledge and perceptions about dietary patterns and physical activity among a group of adults with DM in Sri Lanka using qualitative research methods. METHODS: Fifty adults from a cohort of diabetic patients attending the medical clinics at the National Hospital of Sri Lanka were invited for the study. Data were collected via 10 Focus Group Discussions. Verbatim recording and documenting emotional responses were conducted by two independent observers. Directed content analysis of qualitative data was done with the help of NVIVO v10.0. RESULTS: Mean age was 61.2 +/- 9.9 years and 46 % were males. Mean duration of diabetes was 10.4 +/- 7.5 years. All were aware of the importance of diet in the management of DM. But most had difficulty in incorporating this knowledge into their lives mostly due to social circumstances. The majority described a list of 'good foods' and 'bad foods' for DM. They believed that 'good' foods can be consumed at all times, irrespective of quantity and 'bad' foods should be completely avoided. Many believed that fruits were bad for diabetes, while vegetables were considered as a healthy food choice. The majority thought that there were 'special' foods that help to control blood glucose, the most common being curry leaves and bitter-gourd. Most study participants were aware of the importance of being physical active. However, there was lack of consensus and clarity with regards to type, duration, timing and frequency of physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: Despite understanding the importance of dietary control and physical activity in the management of diabetes, adherence to practices were poor, mainly due to lack of clarity of information provided. There were many myths with regards to diet, some of which have originated from health care professionals. More evidence is needed to support or refute the claims about 'special' foods that the participants believe as being good for diabetes.",

        "The Momordica charantia (MC) fruit has been documented to possess antidiabetic properties. However, these studies were not without controversy surrounding the blood glucose-lowering ability and the mechanism of action in diabetes therapy. In an effort to evaluate such claims in the Jamaican MC species known as cerasee, aqueous extracts of the unripe fruit were studied in normal and diabetic rats. Normal male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into groups (n = 6) orally administered distilled water, 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution, the aqueous extract (400 mg/kg body weight) and glibenclamide (15 mg/kg body weight), respectively prior to assessment of fasting blood glucose (FBG) concentration. The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was conducted in normoglycaemic rats orally administered distilled water, 10% DMSO solution, glibenclamide (15 mg/kg body weight) or aqueous extracts of the fruit (200 and 400 mg/kg body weight). Blood glucose concentration was also monitored in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats administered the aqueous extract (250 mg/kg body weight) or water vehicle after an overnight fast. The aqueous extracts showed no hypoglycaemic or antidiabetic activity. However, the administration of the aqueous extracts (200 and 400 mg/kg body weight) resulted in significant improvement in glucose tolerance of glucose-primed normoglycaemic rats during the OGTT. These data suggest that the glucose-lowering mechanism of the Jamaican MC fruit species likely involves altered glucose absorption across the gastrointestinal tract.",

We aimed here at describing continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) profile of pregnant women after RYGB. METHODS: CGM was performed in 35 consecutive pregnant women after RYGB at 26.2 +/- 5 weeks of gestation. RESULTS: After RYGB, pregnant women display high postprandial interstitial glucose (IG) peaks and low IG before and 2 h after meals. The postprandial IG peak is reached early, within 54 +/- 9 min. The maximum IG values reach 205 mg/dl, and the percentage of time above 140 mg/dl (6.6 +/- 7 %) is similar to what is described in GDM women. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to describe CGM profile in pregnant women after RYGB. CGM features are similar to those of non-pregnant post-RYGB patients, characterized by wide and rapid changes in postprandial IG, and high exposure to hyperglycemia. The exposure to hyperglycemia is similar to what is reported in GDM although the time to postprandial peak is shorter.

The hypoglycaemic and lipid lowering effect of Momordica charantia were screened in laboratory animal model and its potency was compared with a Thiazolidinedione (TZD) group antidiabetic drug like pioglitazone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult healthy albino rats of Wistar strain aged 3-4months, weighing between 170-250gm of either sex were divided into 4 groups; Group 1 (normal controls), Group 2 (diabetic controls), Group 3 (diabetic rats treated with pioglitazone) and Group 4 (diabetic rats treated with bitter melon juice). Type 1 Diabetes was induced in rats by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin at a dose of 55 mg/kg body weight, following which glucose levels were estimated by Accu chek- active glucometer on day 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days to assess the efficacy of Bitter Melon Juice (BMJ) and pioglitazone. After 28 days of treatment, the rats were sacrificed and blood collected from abdominal vena cava was used for estimation of triglycerides by Glycerol 3 phosphate oxidase phenol aminophenazone method and cholesterol by Cholestrol oxidase phenol aminophenazone method. PKC-beta and PPAR-gamma were estimated in the dissected kidneys by using double sandwich ELISA based kits on an automated plate reader. RESULTS: BMJ significantly reduced blood glucose levels in group 4 as compared to diabetic controls (p<0.001). Total cholesterol and triglycerides were significantly reduced in both group 3 and 4. In Group 4, there was reduction in PKC-beta levels, when compared to Group 3(p=0.004). PPAR-gamma levels were increased in both Group 3 and 4, when compared to Group 2. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that BMJ has hypoglycaemic and lipid lowering effect in diabetic animal models. BMJ increases PPAR-gamma activity and decreases PKC-beta activity in kidneys of diabetic rats, thereby preventing the complications of diabetes mellitus. Fresh BMJ mimics action of pioglitazone belonging to TZD group thus showing a potential for further research in identifying the active molecules responsible for glucose and lipid lowering action.",

        "BACKGROUND: alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase digest the carbohydrates and increase the postprandial glucose level in diabetic patients. Inhibiting the activity of these two enzymes can control postprandial hyperglycemia, and reduce the risk of developing diabetes. Bitter gourd or balsam pear is one of the important medicinal plants used for controlling postprandial hyperglycemia in diabetes patients. However, there is limited information available on the presence of alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase inhibiting compounds. In the current study, the protein extracts from the fruits of M. charantia var. charantia (MCC) and M. charantia var. muricata (MCM) were tested for alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase inhibiting activities in vitro, and glucose lowering activity after oral administration in vivo. RESULTS: The protein extract from both MCC and MCM inhibited the activity of alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase through competitive inhibition, which was on par with Acarbose as indicated by in vitro percentage of inhibition (66 to 69 %) and IC50 (0.26 to 0.29 mg/ml). Both the protein extracts significantly reduced peak blood glucose and area under the curve in Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, which were orally challenged with starch and sucrose. CONCLUSIONS: Protein extracts from the fruits of the two varieties of bitter gourd inhibited alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase in vitro and lowered the blood glucose level in vivo on par with Acarbose when orally administrated to Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Further studies on mechanism of action and methods of safe and biologically active delivery will help to develop an anti-diabetic oral protein drug from these plants.",

A cucurbitanetype triterpenoid [(19R,23E)5beta, 19epoxy19methoxycucurbita6,23,25trien3 betaol] previously isolated from M. charantia was demonstrated to possess significant cytotoxicity against cancer cells. The current study investigated the effects of this compound (referred to as compound K16) on diabetes using an alloxaninduced diabetic mouse model. C57BL/6J mice were intraperitoneally injected with alloxan (10 mg/kg body weight), and those with blood glucose concentration higher than 10 mM were selected for further experiments. Diabetic C57BL/6J mice induced by alloxan were administered 0.9% saline solution, metformine (10 mg/kg body weight), or K16 (25 or 50 mg/kg body weight) by gavage for 4 weeks, followed by analysis of blood glucose level, glucose tolerance, serum lipid levels and organ indexes. The results demonstrated that compound K16 significantly reduced blood glucose (3148.6%) and blood lipids (13.542.8%; triglycerides and cholesterol), while improving glucose tolerance compared with diabetic mice treated with saline solution, suggesting a positive improvement in glucose and lipid metabolism following K16 treatment. Furthermore, similarly to metformine, compound K16 markedly upregulated the expression of a number of insulin signaling pathwayassociated proteins, including insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate 1, glycogen synthase kinase 3beta, Akt serine/threonine kinase, and the transcript levels of glucose transporter type 4 and AMPactivated protein kinase alpha1. The results of the current study demonstrated that compound K16 alleviated diabetic metabolic symptoms in alloxaninduced diabetic mice, potentially by affecting genes and proteins involved in insulin metabolism signaling.",

AIM OF THE STUDY: We aimed to investigate how bitter melon powder (BMP) could affect obesity-associated inflammatory responses to ameliorate high-fat diet (HFD)-induced insulin resistance, and investigated whether its anti-inflammatory properties were effected by modulating the gut microbiota. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Obese SD rats (Sprague-Dawley rats, rattus norregicus) were randomly divided into four groups: (a) normal control diet (NCD) and distilled water, (b) HFD and distilled water, (c) HFD and 300mg BMP/kg body weight (bw), (d) HFD and 10mg pioglitazone (PGT)/kg bw. RESULTS: We observed remarkable decreases in the fasting glucose, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR index, serum lipid levels, and cell sizes of epididymal adipose tissues in the BMP and PGT groups after 8 weeks. BMP could significantly improve the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10), and local endotoxin levels compared to the HFD group (p<0.05). BMP suppressed the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) by inhibiting inhibitor of NF-kappaB alpha (IkappaBalpha) degradation and phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase/ p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (JNK/p38 MAPKs) in adipose tissue. Sequencing results illustrated that BMP treatment markedly decreased the proportion of the endotoxin-producing opportunistic pathogens and increased butyrate producers. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that BMP ameliorates insulin sensitivity partly via relieving the inflammatory status in the system and in white adipose tissues of obese rats, and is associated with a proportional regulation of specific gut microbiota.",

Wound fluid was collected on day 4 for analysis, following which rats were euthanized. The granulation tissue encapsulating the wound chamber was removed and processed for histology. Controls included diabetic rats with wound chambers injected with saline (instead of bitter melon) and nondiabetic rats with wound chambers injected with bitter melon. RESULTS: In rats with diabetes, wound granulation tissue treated with bitter melon was well formed, with distinct cellular layers, whereas the saline-treated granulation tissue showed a severe loss of tissue organization and blood vessels. Moreover, the bitter melon treatment increased angiogenesis in the diabetic granulation tissue, marked by abundant microvessels and large blood vessels. In nondiabetic rats, no differences in wound granulation tissues were observed between saline- and bitter melon-treated groups. Bitter melon treatment had no effect on systemic blood glucose levels or insulin receptor substrate 1, suggesting that its stimulatory effect on diabetic granulation tissue was not due to alteration of systemic blood glucose levels. CONCLUSIONS: When applied locally to diabetic wounds, bitter melon extract prevents regression of granulation tissue and blood vessels, thus accelerating and improving wound healing.",

        "CONTEXT: Momordica charantia Linn (Cucurbitaceae) (MC) is used in folk medicine to treat various diseases including diabetes mellitus. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the antidiabetic activities of Momordica charantia (bitter gourd) on streptozotocin-induced type 2 diabetes mellitus in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Wister rats were randomly assigned to 4 groups. Group I, Normal control; Group II, STZ diabetic; Group III and IV, Momordica charantia fruit juice was orally administered to diabetic rats (10 mL/kg/day either as prophylaxis for 14 days before induction of diabetes then 21 days treatment, or as treatment given for 21 days after induction of diabetes). The effects of MC juice were studied both in vivo and in vitro by studying the glucose uptake of isolated rat diaphragm muscles in the presence and absence of insulin. Histopathological examination of pancreas was also performed. RESULTS: This study showed that MC caused a significant reduction of serum glucose (135.99 +/- 6.27 and 149.79 +/- 1.90 vs. 253.40* +/- 8.18) for prophylaxis and treatment respectively, fructosamine (0.99 +/- 0.01 and 1.01 +/- 0.04 vs. 3.04 +/- 0.07), total cholesterol, triglycerides levels, insulin resistance index (1.13 +/- 0.08 and 1.19 +/- 0.05 vs. 1.48 +/- 1.47) and pancreatic malondialdehyde content (p < 0.05). While it induced a significant increase of serum insulin (3.41 +/- 0.08 and 3.28 +/- 0.08 vs. 2.39 +/- 0.27), HDL-cholesterol, total antioxidant capacity levels, beta cell function percent, and pancreatic reduced glutathione (GSH) content (p < 0.05) and improved histopathological changes of the pancreas. It also increased glucose uptake by diaphragms of normal (12.17 +/- 0.60 vs. 9.07 +/- 0.66) and diabetic rats (8.37 +/- 0.28 vs. 4.29 +/- 0.51) in the absence and presence of insulin (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Momordica charantia presents excellent antidiabetic and antioxidant activities and thus has great potential as a new source for diabetes treatment whether it is used for prophylaxis or treatment.",

        2017,
        "INTRODUCTION: The objective of this subgroup analysis is to investigate the effectiveness of liraglutide in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) treated within the primary care physician (PCP) and specialist care settings. METHODS: EVIDENCE is a prospective, observational study of 3152 adults with T2D recently starting or about to start liraglutide treatment in France. We followed patients in the PCP and specialist settings for 2 years to evaluate the effectiveness of liraglutide in glycemic control and body weight reduction. Furthermore, we evaluated the changes in combined antihyperglycemic treatments, the reasons for prescribing liraglutide, patient satisfaction, and safety of liraglutide in these two treatment settings. RESULTS: After 2 years of follow-up, 477 out of 1209 (39.0%) of PCP and 297 out of 1398 (21.2%) of specialist-treated patients still used liraglutide and maintained the glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) target of <7.0%. Significant reductions from baseline were observed in both PCP- and specialist-treated cohorts in mean HbA1c (-1.22% and -0.8%, respectively), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentration (-39 and -23 mg/dL), body weight (-4.4 and -3.8 kg), and body mass index (BMI) (-1.5 and -1.4 kg/m(2)), all p < 0.0001. Reductions in HbA1c and FPG were significantly greater among PCP- compared with specialist-treated patients, p < 0.0001 for both. Patient treatment satisfaction was also significantly increased in both cohorts. Reported gastrointestinal adverse events were less frequent among PCP-treated patients compared with specialist-treated patients (4.5% vs. 16.1%). CONCLUSION: Despite differences in demography and clinical characteristics of patients treated for T2D in PCP and specialty care, greater reduction in HbA1c and increased glycemic control durability were observed with liraglutide in primary care, compared with specialist care. These data suggest that liraglutide treatment could benefit patients in primary care by delaying the need for further treatment intensification.

        "BACKGROUND: The effect of lixisenatide-a prandial once-daily glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist-on glycaemic control in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), stratified by baseline beta-cell function, was assessed. METHODS: The 24-week GetGoal-M, -P and -S trials evaluated the efficacy and safety of lixisenatide in combination with oral antidiabetic agents. This post hoc analysis used data from patients receiving lixisenatide in these trials, divided into matched cohorts by propensity scoring, and stratified according to baseline homeostasis model assessment of beta-cell function (HOMA-beta) index levels, high HOMA-beta: > median HOMA-beta (28.49%); low HOMA-beta: </= median. RESULTS: The matched \"low\" and \"high\" HOMA-beta index cohorts (N = 546 patients) had comparable baseline parameters. Mean change from baseline in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c ) was -0.85% and -0.94% for low and high HOMA-beta cohorts, respectively (P = .2607). Reductions from baseline in fasting plasma glucose (FPG; -0.77 vs -1.04 mmol/L; P = .1496) and postprandial plasma glucose (PPG; -5.82 vs -5.61 mmol/L; P = .7511) were similar in the low versus high HOMA-beta index cohorts. Reduction in body weight was significantly greater in the low versus high HOMA-beta index cohort (-2.06 vs -1.13 kg, respectively; P = .0006). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with T2DM, lixisenatide was associated with reduction in HbA1c and improvements in both FPG and PPG, regardless of beta-cell function, indicating that lixisenatide is effective in reducing hyperglycaemia, even in patients with more advanced stages of T2DM and poor residual beta-cell function.",

        2017,
        "Objective: A rat model is here used to test a hypothesis that Momordica charantia (Bitter melon (BM)) extract favorably alters processes in cardiovascular tissue and is systemically relevant to the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and related cardiovascular disease. Methods: Male Lean and Zucker Obese (ZO) rats were gavage-treated for six weeks with 400 mg/kg body weight bitter melon (BM) extract suspended in mucin-water vehicle, or with vehicle (Control). Animals were segregated into four treatment groups, 10 animals in each group, according to strain (Lean or ZO) and treatment (Control or BM). Following six-week treatment periods, peripheral blood was collected from selected animals, followed by sacrifice, thoracotomy and mounting of isolated working heart setup. Results: Body mass of both Lean and ZO rats was unaffected by treatment, likewise, peripheral blood fasting glucose levels showed no significant treatment-related effects. However, some BM treatment-related improvement was noted in postischemic cardiac functions when Lean, BM-treated animals were compared to vehicle treated Lean control rats. Treatment of Lean, but not ZO, rats significantly reduced the magnitude of infarcted zone in isolated hearts subjected to 30 min of ischemia followed by 2 h of working mode reperfusion. Immunohistochemical demonstration of caspase-3 expression by isolated heart tissues subjected to 30 min of ischemia followed by 2 h of reperfusion, revealed significant correlation between BM treatment and reduced expression of this enzyme in hearts obtained from both Lean and ZO animals. The hierarchy and order of caspase-3 expression from highest to lowest was as follows: ZO rats receiving vehicle > ZO rats receiving BM extract > Lean rats treated receiving vehicle > Lean rats administered BM extract. Outcomes of analyses of peripheral blood content of cardiac-related analytics: with particular relevance to clinical application was a significant elevation in blood of ZO and ZO BM-treated, versus Lean rats of total cholesterol (high density lipoprotein HDL-c + low density lipoprotein LDL-c), with an inferred increase in HDL-c/LDL-c ratio-an outcome associated with decreased risk of atherosclerotic disease. Conclusions: BM extract failed to positively affect T2DM- and cardiovascular-related outcomes at a level suggesting use as a standalone treatment. Nevertheless, the encouraging effects of BM in enhancement of cardiac function, suppression of post-ischemic/reperfused infarct size extent and capacity to modulate serum cholesterol, will likely make it useful as an adjuvant therapy for the management of T2DM and related cardiovascular diseases.",

METHODS: This experimental study was conducted at the University of Health Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan, from February 2013 to January 2014. It comprised male wistar rats weighing 100-150gand aged 6-8 weeks. The animals were divided into 6 groups. Group A1 served as control. Diabetes was induced in groups A2, B2 and C2 using single intravenous injection of 50mg/kg of alloxan. Animals having fasting blood glucose>250mg/dl were considered diabetic. Diabetic rats in groups B2 and C2 and their controls B1 and C1 were given 1ml/kg and 2ml/kg of Citrullus colocynthis aqueous seed extract orally per day for 14 days. Animals were sacrifised on day 15. RESULTS: Of the 48 rats, there were 8(16.7%) in each group. Citrullus colocynthis has stabilized the body weight of rats and difference was statistically significant on days 7(p<0.013) and 14(p<0.001). Citrullus colocynthis significantly reduced (p<0.001) the fasting blood sugar levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner. It increased the islet diameter (p<0.001) and beta cell count (p<0.001). The number of intra-islet capillaries was increased in group C2, but the difference was not statistically significant (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Citrullus colocynthis aqueous seed extract stabilised animal body weight and ameliorated hyperglycaemia in a dose- and time-dependent manner which was attributable to regenerative effect on beta cells and intra-islet vasculature.",

        2017,
        "Momordica charantia is a commonly used food and has been used for the management of diabetes. Our previous study has identified an insulin receptor (IR)-binding protein (mcIRBP) from Momordica charantia. Here we identified the gastro-resistant hypoglycemic bioactive peptides from protease-digested mcIRBP. By in vitro digestion and IR kinase activity assay, we found that a 9-amino-acid-residue peptide, mcIRBP-9, was a gastro-resistant peptide that enhanced IR kinase activities. mcIRBP-9 activated IR signaling transduction pathway, which resulted in the phosphorylation of IR, the translocation of glucose transporter 4, and the uptake of glucose in cells. Intraperitoneal and oral administration of mcIRBP-9 stimulated the glucose clearance by 30.91 +/- 0.39% and 32.09 +/- 0.38%, respectively, in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Moreover, a pilot study showed that daily ingestion of mcIRBP-9 for 30 days decreased the fasting blood glucose levels and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels by 23.62 +/- 6.14% and 24.06 +/- 1.53%, respectively. In conclusion, mcIRBP-9 is a unique gastro-resistant bioactive peptide generated after the digestion of mcIRBP. Furthermore, oral administration of mcIRBP-9 improves both the glucose tolerance and the HbA1c levels in diabetic mice via targeting IR signaling transduction pathway.",

METHODS: In 2015, pilot study was conducted randomly enrolling 30 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus into three groups in SRK college, India. The first group received bitter gourd juice at FBS range between 120 to 300 mg per dl. The second, third group received Knol-khol, ash gourd juice respectively in the same range of fasting blood sugar level. Blood sugar level was evaluated (1/2) hour interval till 2 h after received respective juices. Data were collected for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The mean blood glucose concentration in bitter gourd group was not statistically significant between time points, (P = .176). However, 90 min after the intake of bitter gourd juice shows statistical significant reduction of blood glucose level when compare with fasting level, (p = .049). After Knol khol juice the mean blood glucose level differed statistically significant between time points, shown in (p = .029). But no statistical changes seen in ash gourd group. As a result bitter gourd juice is immediately reducing the blood glucose level, while Knol khol juice reduces the blood sugar level gradually for longer period of 120 min. CONCLUSION: This study shows the significance of hypoglycemic effects of bitter gourd and Knol khol juices among the type 2 Diabetic patients.

        2017,
        "BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases and diabetes are responsible for large number of deaths throughout the globe. Bitter gourd has the potential to become a component of the diet or a dietary supplement for diabetic and pre-diabetic patients owing to the presence of insulin like molecules. Recent investigations have suggested that bitter gourd extracts may ameliorate high fat diet induced obesity and hyperlipidemia in animal models. Moreover, its supplements in food result in lowering weight gain and visceral fat mass. METHODS: The current study was designed to investigate the nutraceutical potential of skin, flesh and whole fruit of bitter gourd cultivars against hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. For the purpose, various bitter gourd cultivars were procured from local market. Bio-evaluation studies were carried out on biochemical parameters using rodent experiment model. RESULTS: From results, it was revealed that maximum reduction in blood glucose skin 1.06%, flesh 2.65%, whole fruit 4.29%, total cholesterol skin 6.60%, flesh 6.04%, whole fruit 6.70%, low density lipoprotein skin 5.55%, flesh 6.81%, whole fruit 6.60%, and triglycerides skin 0.04%, flesh 3.38%, whole fruit 2.02%, were observed. Moreover, insulin skin 2.14%, flesh 3.52%, whole fruit 2.73%, production was slightly enhanced with improved levels of high density lipoprotein in whole fruit of bitter gourd. CONCLUSION: Overwhelmingly, it may be inferred here that bitter gourd holds the potential to significantly improve diabetic conditions and associated late complications with no ill effects on body organs.",

        2017,
        "Estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) has been demonstrated to play a key role in reproduction but also to exert numerous functions in nonreproductive tissues. Accordingly, ERalpha is now recognized as a key regulator of energy homeostasis and glucose metabolism and mediates the protective effects of estrogens against obesity and type 2 diabetes. This chapter attempts to summarize our current understanding of the mechanisms of ERalpha activation and their involvement in the modulation of energy balance and glucose metabolism. We first focus on the experimental studies that constitute the basis of the understanding of ERalpha as a nuclear receptor and more specifically on the key roles played by its two activation functions (AFs). We depict the consequences of the selective inactivation of these AFs in mouse models, which further underline the prominent role of nuclear ERalpha in the prevention of obesity and diabetes, as on the reproductive tract and the vascular system. Besides these nuclear actions, a fraction of ERalpha is associated with the plasma membrane and activates nonnuclear signaling from this site. Such rapid effects, called membrane-initiated steroid signals (MISS), have been characterized in a variety of cell lines and in particular in endothelial cells. The development of selective pharmacological tools that specifically activate MISS as well as the generation of mice expressing an ERalpha protein impeded for membrane localization has just begun to unravel the physiological role of MISS in vivo and their contribution to ERalpha-mediated metabolic protection. Finally, we discuss novel perspectives for the design of tissue-selective ER modulators.",

        "Background/Objective: We investigate the effect of antidiabetic Momordica charantia fruit juice on T cells' differentiation, through plasmatic cytokine quantification in type 1 diabetic rats (T1D). Methods: Male Wistar rats were rendered diabetic by the injection of five low doses of streptozotocin. Then, animals were treated with Momordica charantia fruit juice for 28 consecutive days. Plasmatic levels of Th1 interleukin- (IL-) 02 and interferon- (IFN-) gamma, Th2 (IL-4), and regulatory (IL-10) cytokines were determined in rats. Results: We observed that fruit juice induced a significant decrease in blood glucose of T1D rats. Besides, the concentrations of IL-2 and IFN-gamma significantly increased while those of IL-4 and IL-10 diminished in diabetic rats compared to control animals. Interestingly, after treatment with Momordica charantia fruit juice, IL-4 and IL-10 levels significantly increased in diabetic rats, while IL-2 and IFN-gamma concentrations decreased, suggesting a Th2 phenotype in these animals. Phytochemical analysis of the fruit juice revealed the presence of tannins, flavonoids, and coumarins, compounds which possess antioxidant activity. Conclusion: This study shows that Momordica charantia fruit juice, by lowering the hyperglycemia, induced a shift of proinflammatory Th1 phenotype in T1D rats towards a favorable anti-inflammatory Th2 status. These effects might be due to the presence of antioxidant compounds in the juice and confirms the use of this plant in the treatment of autoimmune type 1 diabetes.",

        "SCOPE: Momordica charantia (M. charantia) has antidiabetic effects, and cucurbitane-type triterpenoid is one of the compounds of M. charantia. This study aims to investigate whether the new cucurbitane-type triterpenoids affect insulin sensitivity both in vitro and in vivo, and the underlying mechanisms. METHODS AND RESULTS: Four compounds (C1-C4) isolated from the ethanol extract of M. charantia enhance glucose uptake in C2C12 myotubes via insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) rather than via adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase. The most potent, compound 2 (C2), significantly increases the activation of IRS-1 and downstream signaling pathways, resulting in glucose transporter 4 translocation. Furthermore, these C2-induced in vitro effects are blocked by specific signal inhibitors. We further evaluate the antidiabetic effect of C2 using a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mouse model. Consistent with in vitro data, treatment with C2 (1.68 mg kg(-1) ) significantly decreases blood glucose level and enhances glycogen storage in STZ-injected mice. These effects appear to be mediated by the IRS-1 signaling pathway in skeletal muscle, not in adipose and liver tissues, suggesting that C2 improves hyperglycemia by increasing glucose uptake into skeletal muscle. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that the new cucurbitane-type triterpenoids have potential for prevention and management of diabetes by improving insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis.",

        "An improvement in parameters of glycemic control has been observed with Momordica charantia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). It is unknown whether this improvement is through a modification of insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity, or both. We hypothesized that M. charantia administration can improve insulin secretion and/or insulin sensitivity in patients with T2DM, without pharmacological treatment. The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of M. charantia administration on insulin secretion and sensitivity. A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, clinical trial was carried out in 24 patients who received M. charantia (2000 mg/day) or placebo for 3 months. A 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was done before and after the intervention to calculate areas under the curve (AUC) of glucose and insulin, total insulin secretion (insulinogenic index), first phase of insulin secretion (Stumvoll index), and insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index). In the M. charantia group, there were significant decreases in weight, body mass index (BMI), fat percentage, waist circumference (WC), glycated hemoglobin A1c (A1C), 2-h glucose in OGTT, and AUC of glucose. A significant increase in insulin AUC (56,562 +/- 36,078 vs. 65,256 +/- 42,720 pmol/L/min, P = .043), in total insulin secretion (0.29 +/- 0.18 vs. 0.41 +/- 0.29, P = .028), and during the first phase of insulin secretion (557.8 +/- 645.6 vs. 1135.7 +/- 725.0, P = .043) was observed after M. charantia administration. Insulin sensitivity was not modified with any intervention. In conclusion, M. charantia administration reduced A1C, 2-h glucose, glucose AUC, weight, BMI, fat percentage, and WC, with an increment of insulin AUC, first phase and total insulin secretion.",

In vitro and in vivo studies suggest its glycemic control potential; however, clinical studies produced conflicting results. AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the efficacy of M. charantia preparations in lowering elevated plasma glucose level in prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. METHODS: Electronic search of the Cochrane library, PubMed(R), CINAHL, and SCOPUS databases was done from 1st January 1960-30th April 2018 without language restriction. Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed risk of bias of articles. Revman var. 5.3 software was used for data synthesis in meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was assessed using Chi-square and I(2) tests. Treatment effect was estimated using mean difference at follow up in outcome measures between M. charantia preparations and placebo or oral hypoglycemic agents control group. The protocol of this study has a registration number PROSPERO CRD42018083653. RESULTS: Ten studies of type 2 diabetes mellitus (n=1045) were included in the meta-analysis. They had 4-16 weeks follow up and overall moderate to high risk of bias. Compared to placebo, M. charantia monoherbal formulation significantly reduces FPG, PPG and HBA1c with mean difference of -0.72mmol/L, (95% CI: -1.33, -0.12), I(2) =14%, -1.43mmol/L, (95% CI: -2.18, -0.67), I(2) =0, -0.26%, (95% CI: -0.49, -0.03), I(2) =0 respectively. M. charantia also lowered FPG in prediabetes (mean difference -0.31mmol/L, n=52); the evidence was downgraded to low quality because the study had unclear risk of bias and inadequate sample size. No serious adverse effects were reported. CONCLUSION: M. charantia adjunct preparations improved glycemic control in T2DM patients. However, this conclusion is based on low to very low quality evidences for the primary outcomes and sparse data for several safety outcomes, thus, warrant further research. Particularly needed are the researches that focus on standardizing M. charantia formulation and determine its efficacy and safety in clinical trials with adequate sample size, designed with random sequence generation, allocation concealment of intervention and blinding of both research personnel and participants.",

Combined circular dichroism (CD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) analyses indicated that after linking with chromium ions, the flexibility of the three-dimensional structure of the polysaccharide increased. After the treatment of MCPIIaC for four weeks, the mice with STZ-induced DM exhibited significantly lower fasting blood glucose levels and body weight, whereas higher insulin levels and antioxidant enzyme activity than in the diabetic group. Optimal effects were obtained with a dosage of 30mg MCPIIaC/kg body weight. Histological analysis indicated that MCPIIaC alleviated the oxidative tissue damage in STZ-lesioned mice. An acute toxicity experiment indicated that MCPIIaC was safe at a dose of 1500mg/kg. These results suggest that MCPIIaC might be an excellent candidate hypoglycemic agent for the prevention of diabetes.",

        2018,
        "BACKGROUND: Bitter melon (BM, Momordica charantia) has been accepted as an effective complementary treatment of metabolic disorders such as diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia and etc. However it is unclear whether BM can prevent the progression of atherosclerosis. To confirm the effects of BM on atherosclerosis and explore its underlying mechanisms, we design this study. METHODS: Twenty four male apolipoprotein E knock-out (ApoE-/-) mice aged 8 weeks were randomly divided into control group fed with high fat diet (HFD) only and BM group fed with HFD mixed with 1.2%w/w BM. After 16 weeks, body weight, food intake, blood glucose, serum lipids were measured and the atherosclerotic plaque area and its histological composition were analyzed. The expression of vascular cell adhesive molecules and inflammatory cytokines in the aortas were determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Body weight gain and serum triglycerides (TG) significantly decreased in BM group. BM reduced not only the atherosclerotic plaque area and the contents of collagen fibers in atherosclerotic plaques but also the serum soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 and P-selectin levels, as well as the expressions of monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and interleukin (IL)-6 in aortas. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that dietary BM can attenuate the development of atherosclerosis in ApoeE-/- mice possibly through reducing triglyceride and anti-inflammation mechanism.",

        "BACKGROUND: The cardiovascular safety profile of dapagliflozin, a selective inhibitor of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 that promotes glucosuria in patients with type 2 diabetes, is undefined. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients with type 2 diabetes who had or were at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease to receive either dapagliflozin or placebo. The primary safety outcome was a composite of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or ischemic stroke. The primary efficacy outcomes were MACE and a composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure. Secondary efficacy outcomes were a renal composite (>/=40% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate to <60 ml per minute per 1.73 m(2) of body-surface area, new end-stage renal disease, or death from renal or cardiovascular causes) and death from any cause. RESULTS: We evaluated 17,160 patients, including 10,186 without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, who were followed for a median of 4.2 years. In the primary safety outcome analysis, dapagliflozin met the prespecified criterion for noninferiority to placebo with respect to MACE (upper boundary of the 95% confidence interval [CI], <1.3; P<0.001 for noninferiority). In the two primary efficacy analyses, dapagliflozin did not result in a lower rate of MACE (8.8% in the dapagliflozin group and 9.4% in the placebo group; hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.03; P=0.17) but did result in a lower rate of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure (4.9% vs. 5.8%; hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.73 to 0.95; P=0.005), which reflected a lower rate of hospitalization for heart failure (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.88); there was no between-group difference in cardiovascular death (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.17). A renal event occurred in 4.3% in the dapagliflozin group and in 5.6% in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.87), and death from any cause occurred in 6.2% and 6.6%, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.04). Diabetic ketoacidosis was more common with dapagliflozin than with placebo (0.3% vs. 0.1%, P=0.02), as was the rate of genital infections that led to discontinuation of the regimen or that were considered to be serious adverse events (0.9% vs. 0.1%, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 diabetes who had or were at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, treatment with dapagliflozin did not result in a higher or lower rate of MACE than placebo but did result in a lower rate of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure, a finding that reflects a lower rate of hospitalization for heart failure.

Several experimental studies suggest that bitter melon (Momordica charantia) improves lipid metabolism in animal models of dyslipidemia and diabetes. This study evaluated the effects of bitter melon extracts on lipid metabolism following a 30-day treatment period in Japanese adults. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included 43 adult volunteers who received either 100 mg of hot-water extracts of bitter melon (n = 23) or a placebo (n = 20) three times daily for 30 days. The body weight, blood pressure, and levels of LDL-C and other blood parameters of each subject were measured before and after the study period. The results showed that the intervention group exhibited significantly lower LDL-C levels (P = 0.02) as compared with the control group, and there were no significant changes in either group in terms of body weight, body mass index, systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, or blood glucose. These results suggested that bitter melon extracts might effectively lower LDL-C levels in humans and exhibit potential therapeutic value for the management of dyslipidemic conditions.",

This study was aimed to fully compare the antidiabetic effects and the potential mechanism of saponins (SMC) and polysaccharides (PMC) from M. charantia in STZ-induced type 2 diabetic mice with high-fat diet. Three dosages of SMC (L-SMC: 20mg/kg, M-SMC: 40mg/kg, H-SMC: 80mg/kg) have a certain of therapeutic effect on type 2 diabetic mice, and M-SMC (40mg/kg) is the optimal dosage for the prevention and treatment of diabetes. The results showed that oral administration of SMC, especially M-SMC (40mg/kg) compared to PMC (500mg/kg), could significantly restore the body weight, reduce fasting blood glucose levels, ameliorate insulin resistance and increase the proportion of hepatic phosphorylated adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK)/total protein. The above results proved that hypoglycemic mechanism of SMC might involve in the AMPK/NF-kappaB signal pathway by activating AMPK phosphorylation and regulating the energy metabolism of the body. However, oral administration of PMC could significant improve the antioxidant capacity by increasing the level of SOD and decreasing the level of MDA, and alleviate the STZ-induced organ tissues (kidney and pancreas), which proved that the hypoglycemic mechanism of PMC might by repairing the pancreatic beta cells damaged by STZ.",

        "The beneficial metabolic actions of estrogen-based therapies are mainly mediated by estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), a nuclear receptor that regulates gene transcription through two activation functions (AFs): AF-1 and AF-2. Using mouse models deleted electively for ERalphaAF-1 (ERalphaAF-1 degrees ) or ERalphaAF-2 (ERalphaAF-2 degrees ), we determined their respective roles in the actions of estrogens on body composition and glucose homeostasis in response to either a normal diet or a high-fat diet (HFD). ERalphaAF-2 degrees males and females developed accelerated weight gain, massive adiposity, severe insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance--quite reminiscent of the phenotype observed in mice deleted for the entire ERalpha protein (ERalpha(-/-)). In striking contrast, ERalphaAF-1 degrees and wild-type (wt) mice shared a similar metabolic phenotype. Accordingly, 17beta-estradiol administration regulated key metabolic genes in insulin-sensitive tissues and conferred a strong protection against HFD-induced metabolic disturbances in wt and ERalphaAF-1 degrees ovariectomized mice, whereas these actions were totally abrogated in ERalphaAF-2 degrees and ERalpha(-/-) mice. Thus, whereas both AFs have been previously shown to contribute to endometrial and breast cancer cell proliferation, the protective effect of estrogens against obesity and insulin resistance depends on ERalphaAF-2 but not ERalphaAF-1, thereby delineating new options for selective modulation of ERalpha.",

Whereas several molecular mechanisms are known for gemcitabine resistance in PanC cells, altered metabolism and bioenergetics are not yet studied. Here, we compared metabolic and bioenergetic functions between gemcitabine-resistant (GR) and gemcitabine-sensitive (GS) PanC cells and underlying molecular mechanisms, together with efficacy of a natural agent bitter melon juice (BMJ). GR PanC cells showed distinct morphological features including spindle-shaped morphology and a decrease in E-cadherin expression. GR cells also showed higher ATP production with an increase in oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). Molecular studies showed higher expression of glucose transporters (GLUT1 and 4) suggesting an increase in glucose uptake by GR cells. Importantly, GR cells showed a significant increase in Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation and their inhibition decreased cell viability, suggesting their role in survival and drug resistance of these cells. Recently, we reported strong efficacy of BMJ against a panel of GS cells in culture and nude mice, which we expanded here and found that BMJ was also effective in decreasing both Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation and viability of GR PanC cells. Overall, we have identified novel mechanisms of gemcitabine resistance in PanC cells which are targeted by BMJ. Considering the short survival in PanC patients, our findings could have high translational potential in controlling this deadly malignancy.",

The anti-diabetic properties involve inhibiting intestinal alpha-glucosidase and glucose transport, protecting islet beta-cells, enhancing insulin secretion, increasing hepatic glucose disposal, decreasing gluconeogenesis, and even ameliorating insulin resistance. Moreover, the expressions of PPARs could also be activated and up-regulated. Meanwhile, its anticancer properties are mostly due to apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and expression of serum factors associated with immunity.

        "We studied the long-term effects of streptozotocin-induced diabetes on tissue-specific cytochrome P450 (CYP) and glutathione-dependent (GSH-dependent) xenobiotic metabolism in rats. In addition, we also studied the effect of antidiabetic Momordica charantia (karela) fruit-extract feeding on the modulation of xenobiotic metabolism and oxidative stress in rats with diabetes. Our results have indicated an increase (35-50%) in CYP4A-dependent lauric acid hydroxylation in liver, kidney, and brain of diabetic rats. About a two-fold increase in CYP2E-dependent hepatic aniline hydroxylation and a 90-100% increase in CYP1A-dependent ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase activities in kidney and brain were also observed. A significant increase (80%) in aminopyrene N-demethylase activity was observed only in rat kidney, and a decrease was observed in the liver and brain of diabetic rats. A significant increase (77%) in NADPH-dependent lipid peroxidation (LPO) in kidney of diabetic rats was also observed. On the other hand, a decrease in hepatic LPO was seen during chronic diabetes. During diabetes an increased expression of CYP1A1, CYP2E1, and CYP4A1 isoenzymes was also seen by Western blot analysis. Karela-juice feeding modulates the enzyme expression and catalytic activities in a tissue- and isoenzyme-specific manner. A marked decrease (65%) in hepatic GSH content and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity and an increase (about two-fold) in brain GSH and GST activity was observed in diabetic rats. On the other hand, renal GST was markedly reduced, and GSH content was moderately higher than that of control rats. Western blot analyses using specific antibodies have confirmed the tissue-specific alterations in the expression of GST isoenzymes. Karela-juice feeding, in general, reversed the effect of chronic diabetes on the modulation of both P450-dependent monooxygenase activities and GSH-dependent oxidative stress related LPO and GST activities. These results have suggested that the modulation of xenobiotic metabolism and oxidative stress in various tissues may be related to altered metabolism of endogenous substrates and hormonal status during diabetes. The findings may have significant implications in elucidating the therapeutic use of antidiabetic drugs and management of Type 1 diabetes in chronic diabetic patients.",

The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of treatment of Momordica fruit extract (MFE) and sodium orthovanadate, separately and in combination, on serum and tissue lipid profile and on the activities of lipogenic enzymes in alloxan induced diabetic rats. The results show that there was a significant (p < 0.01) increase in serum total lipids, triglycerides and total cholesterol levels after 21 days of alloxan diabetes. In the liver and kidney of diabetic rats the levels of total lipids and triglycerides also increased significantly (p < 0.01) while levels of total cholesterol decreased significantly (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). The lipogenic enzymes showed decreased activity in the diabetic liver, while in kidney they showed an increased activity. When compared with the controls these changes were significant. The treatment of alloxan diabetic rats with MFE and SOV prevented these alterations and maintained all parameters near control values.

The ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay of plasma showed that CLnA treatment caused improvement in the FRAP value which was altered after STZ treatment due to an increased level of free radicals. Expression of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-6 in blood and expression of hepatic NF-kappaB (p65) increased significantly after STZ treatment due to increased inflammation which was restored with the administration of CLnA isomers.

Then, initial analysis of the great controlled study WHI and HERS causes unfavorable judgment of overall risk-benefit balance evaluation. However, the situation isn't so contrasted, and many arguments are in favor of vascular benefit with hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). Menopause and HRT influence the cardiovascular risk factors. The oral-estrogen taking conducts to significant decrease of LDL cholesterol rate, and significant increase of HDL and triglyceride plasma levels. Otherwise, there is a decrease of insulin-resistance and incidence of type 2 diabetes in substituted women. At least, oral estrogens seem to be responsible of deleterious effect pro-inflammatory and prothrombotic. The transdermal taking would limit these effects. During the precocious stage of atheromatous plaque formation, estradiol has a really protective function, with endothelial effect, limiting the induction and the activation of proinflammatory cells. On the contrary, when plaques are formed, giving estrogens could be harmful, because it could facilitate plaque rupture by pro-inflammatory effect. In 1998, then in 2002, the publication of the two main controlled study WHI and HERS removes the legitimacy of HRT in cardiovascular prevention terms, however, post-hoc analysis since published, have moderate the initial version: more and more convincing arguments suggest vascular benefit of HRT, if it begins just after menopause and probably before the existence of advanced atheromatous plaque, bringing the notion of the opportunity window.

        "The present work entailed perspicacious fabrication of Bitter Gourd Seed Oil Nanoemulsion (BGO-NE) for increasing bioavailability of CLnA in oxidative stress induced in vivo system. The BGO-NE was characterized and evaluated for dimensional as well as rheological changes periodically during a 12 week storage period. BGO comprising approximately 50 % alpha-eleostearic acid, was assessed in conventional and NE formulation at different doses, for its ability to stimulate antioxidative enzyme marker paradigm comprising SOD, GPx, CAT and GSH, inherent to the subjects under study. The formulated BGO-NE (d < 100 nm) was found to be stable for 12 weeks compared to BGO-CE as was determined by particle size characterization and associated parameters. Diet supplementation of 0.5 % (w/v) BGO-NE formulation exhibited maximum efficiency in countering oxidative stress as compared to 1 % BGO-NE formulation and equivalent doses of BGO-CE. Higher efficacy at very low dose of the nano-sized formulation was thus, also established. Histopathological data from liver, pancreas and kidney sections corroborated the above findings. The present study with formulated BGO-NE and BGO-CE evaluates and confirms the implications of a NE formulation of a bioactive lipid - conjugated linolenic acid (CLnA), targeting specific in vivo processes to counter the negative influence of excess ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species) in the system. It, thus presents itself as a potent nutraceutical against diabetes mellitus in an optimized delivery system.",

        "Diabetes mellitus is one of the risk factors in the development of vascular complications. Decreased nitric oxide (NO) production and increased lipid peroxidation in diabetes mellitus are the dominant exaggerating factors. Mormodica charantia (MC) was proven to be useful in improving diabetes mellitus and its complications. In the present study, a total of 40 male Sprague-Dawley rats were used. Diabetes was induced by a single dose (50 mg/kg) of streptozotocin (STZ), intramuscularly. Following 4 weeks of STZ induction, the animals were equally divided into five groups (n = 8); Control group (Ctrl), control group treated with MC (Ctrl-MC), diabetic untreated group (DM-Ctrl), diabetic group treated with MC (DM-MC) and diabetic group treated with metformin 150 g/kg (DM-Met). Oral administration of the MC fruit extract (1.5 g/kg) was continued for 28 days. DM-MC group showed a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in blood pressure, total cholesterol and triglyceride levels compared to the DM-Ctrl group. Aortic tissue NO level was significantly increased and malondialdehyde level was decreased in the DM-MC group. Immunohistochemical staining showed an increase in eNOS expression in the endothelial lining of the DM-MC group. Similarly, morphological deterioration of the aortic tissues was reverted to normal. In summary, treatment with the MC fruit extract exerted the significant vasculoprotective effect in the type 1 diabetic rat model.",

        2017,
        "INTRODUCTION: In traditional medicine, Citrullus colocynthis is used to treat diabetes, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular diseases, inflammation, and oxidative stress, all of which can appear when a diet rich in vegetable fats, such as palm oil, is continuously consumed. Such high-fat diets are chronic stressors of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The objective of our study was to analyze and evaluate the effects of colocynth total alkaloids and glycosides on metabolic, hormonal, and structural disorders of the adrenal medulla in Wistar rats fed a high-fat diet. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty six Wistar rats were distributed as follows: six control animals received a standard laboratory diet; twenty experimental rats received the standard laboratory diet supplemented with palm oil - the high-fat diet (HFD). After seven months of this diet, the HFD group was subdivided into rats treated for the next 2 months with either alkaloid extract (HFD-ALk group) or ethanol extract of glycosides (HFD-GLc) or animals on HFD only. Plasma metabolites and ACTH concentrations were measured by standard methods. Sections of adrenal medulla were stained by Heidenhain-Azan method and Sudan Black. RESULTS: The adrenal medulla of the HFD rats showed prominent structural changes, such as hypertrophy of chromaffin and ganglion cells, vacuolation, inflammatory foci, and fibrosis. The biochemical and hormonal parameters were significantly improved in the HFD rats treated with alkaloid and glycoside extracts of Citrullus colocynthis. Moreover, the morphological changes of the adrenal medulla were attenuated in HFD-ALk and HFD-Glc rats. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study indicate that phytotherapy using Citrullus colocynthis alkaloids may correct metabolic and hormonal perturbations as well as adrenal medulla structure of rats maintained on HFD.",

        "The influence of Lactobacillus plantarum-fermentation on the structure and anti-diabetic effects of Momordica charantia polysaccharides were evaluated. High-fat diet and streptozotocin-induced type 2 diabetic rats were administrated with polysaccharides from fermented and non-fermented Momordica charantia (FP and NFP) for 4 weeks. Fermentation affected the physicochemical characterization, monosaccharide composition, molecular weight, and viscosity of Momordica charantia polysaccharides. Treatment with FP significantly ameliorated hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, hyperlipidemia, and oxidative stress in diabetic rats compared with NFP. Moreover, the diversity and abundance of gut microbiota (Lactococcus laudensis and Prevotella loescheii) in diabetic rats were notably increased by treatment with FP in comparison to NFP. Meanwhile, FP-treated diabetic rats exhibited more colonic short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and lower pH values than that in NFP-treated rats. Overall, Lactobacillus plantarum-fermentation could enhance the anti-diabetes effects of Momordica charantia polysaccharides in rats by modifying the structure of polysaccharides to optimize gut microbiota and heighten the production of SCFAs.",

        2009,
        "Eleostearic acid (alpha-ESA) is a conjugated linolenic acid that makes up approximately 60% of Momordica charantia (bitter melon) seed oil. Prior work found that water extract from bitter melon was able to inhibit breast cancer. Here, we investigated effects of alpha-ESA on both estrogen receptor (ER)-negative MDA-MB-231 (MDA-wt) and ER-positive MDA-ERalpha7 human breast cancer cells. We found that alpha-ESA inhibited proliferation of both MDA-wt and MDA-ERalpha7 cells, whereas conjugated linoleic acid had comparatively weak antiproliferative activity at 20 to 80 micromol/L concentrations. We also found that alpha-ESA (40 micromol/L) treatment led to apoptosis in the range of 70% to 90% for both cell lines, whereas conjugated linoleic acid (40 micromol/L) resulted in only 5% to 10% apoptosis, similar to results for control untreated cells. Addition of alpha-ESA also caused loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor as well as endonuclease G from the mitochondria to the nucleus. Additionally, alpha-ESA caused a G(2)-M block in the cell cycle. We also investigated the potential for lipid peroxidation to play a role in the inhibitory action of alpha-ESA. We found that when the breast cancer cells were treated with alpha-ESA in the presence of the antioxidant alpha-tocotrienol (20 micromol/L), the growth inhibition and apoptosis effects of alpha-ESA were lost. An AMP-activated protein kinase inhibitor (Dorsomorphin) was also able to partially abrogate the effects of alpha-ESA, whereas a caspase inhibitor (BOC-D-FMK) did not. These results illustrate that alpha-ESA can block breast cancer cell proliferation and induce apoptosis through a mechanism that may be oxidation dependent.",

        2010,
        "In the present study, a special kind of Momordica charantia seeds produced in Hai Nan was selected and analyzed. Firstly, inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrophotometry (ICP-AES) was used to determine the mineral elements. It was clear that the contents of K, Mg and P are the highest in the seeds; Cr and Zn takes up to 5.65% and 45.45% high, especially, which are rare in plant foods. These minerals, especially Cr and Zn might have a complex effect on those proteins or polysaccharides and form a stronger anticipation of hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia and cholesterol. Secondly, seed oil was extracted by supercritical CO2 extraction with a yield ratio of 36.89, and the fatty acids were treated by methylation in alkaline process and purified by thin-layer chromatography, then analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) identification. The saturated fatty acids (SFA) take up 36.712, and mainly are stearic acid; monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) is only 3.33% which is dominantly linoleic acid (LA); Polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) accounted for 59.96%, and the alpha-eleostearic acid takes up 54.26% as the main fatty acids in all. The plentiful alpha-eleostearic acid leads to strong effects of inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, lowering blood fat, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory and preventing cardiovascular diseases, and so on. Knowing clearly the mineral elements distribution and identifying the composition of fatty acid, especially the main fatty acids in the oil, are both of great guiding importance to further exploit the clinical and edible value in Momordica charantiap seeds.",

        "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), one of the transcription factors that regulate lipid metabolism and energy use in tumor cells, is a viable target for cancer therapy. In our search for potential PPARgamma activator, extracts from five Formosan plants were tested. Among them, Momordica charantia L. showed the highest ability to activate PPARgamma, which led us to identify its potential constituents. Among the seven compounds isolated from M. charantia, a triterpenoid, 5beta,19-epoxy-19-methoxycucurbita-6,23-dien-3beta,25-diol (compound 1), was identified as a PPARgamma activator with an IC50 of 10 muM in breast cancer MCF-7 cells. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that compound 1 induced G1 cell cycle arrest which might be attributable to the modulation of phosphorylation and expression of numerous key signaling effectors, including cyclin D1, CDK6, and p53. Notably, compound 1 downregulated the expression of histone deacetylase 1, leading to increased histone H3 acetylation. Taken together, these findings suggest that compound 1 may have therapeutic applications in cancer treatment through PPARgamma activation. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

        "Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is aggressive with a worse prognosis. We have recently shown that bitter melon extract (BME) treatment was more effective in inhibition of TNBC tumor growth in mouse models as compared to ER positive breast tumor growth. Aberrant dysregulation of lipid metabolism is associated with breast cancer progression, however, anti-cancer mechanism of BME linking lipid metabolism in breast cancer growth remains unexplored. Here, we observed that accumulation of esterified cholesterol was reduced in BME treated TNBC cell lines as compared to control cells. We next evaluated expression levels of acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT-1) in TNBC cells treated with BME. Our results demonstrated that BME treatment inhibited ACAT-1 expression in TNBC cells. Subsequently, we found that sterol regulatory element-binding proteins-1 and -2, and FASN was significantly reduced in BME treated TNBC cell lines. Low-density lipoprotein receptor was also downregulated in BME treated TNBC cells as compared to control cells. We further demonstrated that BME feeding reduced tumor growth in TNBC mammospheres implanted into NSG mice, and inhibits ACAT-1 expression. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating BME suppresses TNBC cell growth through ACAT-1 inhibition, and have potential for additional therapeutic regimen against human breast cancer.",

Polyphenols are potent antioxidants in plant foods, but their contribution to such protective effects is yet to be established. This study attempted to generate a database on the antioxidant activity (AOA) and phenolic content (PC) of some plant foods commonly consumed in India and to assess the contribution of the PC to their AOA. Plant foods belonging to different food groups such as cereals, legumes, oil seeds, oils, green leafy vegetables, other vegetables, spices, roots and tubers were analysed for AOA and PC. AOA was the highest in black pepper (0.43 mg food required for 50% inhibition of the coupled auto-oxidation of beta-carotene and linoleic acid in a mixture in vitro) and it had the highest PC (191 mg gallic acid equivalent/100 g food). The AOA (18.4 mg) as well as the PC (not detectable) were the lowest in sunflower oil. PC in oil seeds was higher than that in the oil, which could be due to the hydrophilic nature of phenolics and suggests the need for greater use of oil seeds than oils. A significant correlation was observed between the AOA and PC of the plant foods studied in general (r=-0.465), but the coefficient of correlation and determination were high only in spices (r=-0.86 and r2 =74%, respectively) and dehusked legumes (r=-0.65 and r2 = 42.2%, respectively).

        2012,
        "Insulin resistance is a causative factor for type 2 diabetes, whereas the development of insulin resistance is closely related to chronic inflammation induced by factors such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Momordica charantia, also known as bitter melon, has been used as an herbal medicine and reported to ameliorate inflammation and hyperglycemia. Previously, a triterpene 5beta,19-epoxy-25-methoxy-cucurbita-6,23-diene-3beta,19-diol (EMCD), purified from M. charantia L. wild variant WB24, was found to activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and have a hypoglycaemic effect in TNF-alpha-treated FL83B cells. AMPK has been a target for developing anti-diabetic medicine and suggested to play a role in anti-inflammation. The current study aims to investigate if EMCD might repress TNF-alpha-induced inflammation via AMPK. TNF-alpha-induced inflammation in FL83B cells was characterized using Western blotting and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Consequently, the expression of inflammatory markers including inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), the p65 subunit of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1B, TNF-alpha and interleukin-1beta were significantly elevated by TNF-alpha in the cell, and EMCD obviously suppressed the TNF-alpha-induced expression of these markers. When the effect of EMCD was tested simultaneously with epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a catechin from green tea reported to be anti-inflammatory, EMCD showed a more obvious anti-inflammatory activity than EGCG did. Investigation of the underlying mechanism suggested that EMCD inhibited the activation of the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex and the NF-kappaB pathway, and the effect was likely independent of AMPK. Collectively, the multiple functions of EMCD suggest it to be a potential agent in treating diabetic complications and other inflammation-related disorders.",

The basis of this \"epidemic\" is either a diet too often characterized by excessive consumption of saturated and trans-esterified fatty acids, simple sugars and salt, either a sedentary lifestyle. PURPOSE: The aim of this review is to focus on the phytochemicals that have a more positive effect on the treatment and/or prevention of MetS. CHAPTERS: Treatment strategies for MetS include pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic options, with varying degrees of success rate. The first is indicated for patients with high cardiovascular risk, while the second one is the most cost-effective preventive approach for subjects with borderline parameters and for patients intolerant to pharmacological therapy. MetS non-pharmacological treatments could involve the use of nutraceuticals, most of which has plant origins (phytochemicals), associated with lifestyle improvement. The chapter will discuss the available evidence on soluble fibres from psyllium and other sources, cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid and other cinnamon phytochemicals, berberine, corosolic acid from banaba, charantin from bitter gourd, catechins and flavonols from green tea and cocoa. Vegetable omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, alliin from garlic, soy peptides, and curcumin from curcuma longa.

Different growth parameters including growth emergence rate, seedling vigor, growth and weight of root, shoot and leaf were studied. The results showed positive effect on Momordica charantia seed growth and phenolic acids production i.e. ferulic acid - 43.95 ppm and sinapic acid - 18.39 ppm. The antiglycation assay showed 23.45+/-1.23% antiglycation activity of primed-seed fruit extract as compare to control seed fruit extract (0.87+/-0.03%). On the basis of the results, it is concluded that tyrosine primed seed fruit extract could effectively be further tested for pre-clinical and clinical studies to manage diabetes mellitus disease.",

        "vitamin a - A Review of Promising Natural Chemopreventive Agents for Head and Neck Cancer.",
        2018,
        "Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) accounts for 300,000 deaths per year worldwide, and overall survival rates have shown little improvement over the past three decades. Current treatment methods including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy leave patients with secondary morbidities. Thus, treatment of HNSCC may benefit from exploration of natural compounds as chemopreventive agents. With excellent safety profiles, reduced toxicities, antioxidant properties, and general acceptance for use as dietary supplements, natural compounds are viewed as a desirable area of investigation for chemoprevention. Though most of the field is early in development, numerous studies display the potential utility of natural compounds against HNSCC. These compounds face additional challenges such as low bioavailability for systemic delivery, potential toxicities when consumed in pharmacologic doses, and acquired resistance. However, novel delivery vehicles and synthetic analogues have shown to overcome some of these challenges. This review covers 11 promising natural compounds in the chemoprevention of HNSCC including vitamin A, curcumin, isothiocyanate, green tea, luteolin, resveratrol, genistein, lycopene, bitter melon, withaferin A, and guggulsterone. The review discusses the therapeutic potential and associated challenges of these agents in the chemopreventive efforts against HNSCC. Cancer Prev Res; 11(8); 441-50. (c)2018 AACR.",
